            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER To The READER.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Preface is not to Commend theſe Letters, being ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his Name who
<pb facs="tcp:59422:3"/>wrote them; and <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mazarine</hi> is ſo well known, that 'twould be needleſs to undertake the giving any account of him; ſo that we have only to ſay what they Contain, and how they are Publiſhed.</p>
            <p>A Man need only to caſt his Eyes on them, to ſee they are not Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; the Tour, the Style, the Matter it ſelf, all is Natural, and ſavour of the Original. Had they
<pb facs="tcp:59422:3"/>indeed been Printed as we found them, they would have been unintelligible to moſt Readers; whether the fault comes from the Copyeſt or the Cardinal, who has more than once acknowledged he was but a bad Writer of <hi>French,</hi> and there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he never ſpake truer.</p>
            <p>It is eaſily ſeen we have alter'd nothing, but only endeavour'd to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing intelligible;
<pb facs="tcp:59422:4"/>and to this end, inſerted in the Margent what was thought needful for the explaining ſeveral difficult Paſſages of the Text.</p>
            <p>As to the Subject of theſe Letters, we expect the Reader ſhould think himſelf oblig'd for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them. It is only pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there are no more of them: Yet theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enough to ſhew they are not the leaſt; They fully diſcover to us
<pb facs="tcp:59422:4"/>he Cardinal's Genius, and his way of mannaging In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues. The circuits he took to bring <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> to his Ends, are not the leaſt curious places in the Book. But in my Opinion, nothing excels the Letters he wrote to the King, on the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majeſty ſhew'd at that time to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Niece, married ſome time after to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>Colonna:</hi> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:59422:5"/>the Twenty Third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me admirable. I could never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Cardinal ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a Man, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Politick he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, yet we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Generoſity; and let People ſay what they will, I do not doubt but he was able enough to undertake this Affair, and Powerful enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf in it, and
<pb facs="tcp:59422:5"/>romove all Obſtacles which might be thrown in his way.<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

               </opener>
               <p>I Have ſent the Footman who brought me your Letter of the <hi>7th</hi> Inſtant, to deliver to the Perſon whom you know that which the Confident<note n="*" place="margin">The King.</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me; believing that ſhe was ſtill with me; and I anſwer you by Hers whom I diſpatch to you, that I cannot
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59422:7"/>ſufficiently expreſs my diſpleaſure, obſerving the earneſtneſs of the Confident, and that inſtead of practiſing the Remedies, which may moderate his paſſion, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nothing which may augment it. And if you connive at what he does, as you ſend me word, after the example of the Perſon which belongs to him, he will be always glad to do as he does, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has in a manner your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and will hereby be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to greater inconveniencies than you imagine. As for my part I will never give over the doing my duty, and if I ſee that this avails nothing, I know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto my Fidelity and Zeal and Tenderneſs, which I have for the ſervice and reputation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident will oblige me; which is to ſay, that I ſhall dye with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of having been ſo wretched, that any thing which relates to me could be the cauſe of ſoiling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59422:7"/>his glory, which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe up to the higheſt point, employing for this end all my ſtudy and care, and I may ſay, without vanity, not without ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Seeing you deſire to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you will not be diſpleaſed to ſee what I write hereupon to the Confident, and you will do me the juſtice to be perſwaded, that though the ſtate of Affairs permits me to deal thus, I leſſen in nothing the deſire I have to ſee my ſelf near the Perſons I moſt eſteem. And ſeeing you teſtifie that you are well pleaſed, when I declared to you the ſatisfaction which I have from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I will tell you it is above what I can expreſs, ſeeing the manner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they write to me, and remembring what you have had the goodneſs to tell me on a certain point, which has always given a great deal of trouble to the Mother. I proteſt to you that nothing has
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59422:8"/>toucht me equally to what you have been pleaſed to tell me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and with ſo obliging a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, that nothing is capable to efface it ever out of my mind, which has for you all the ſentiments which the Angels themſelves can deſire.</p>
               <p>I wrote to Madam <hi>de Venelle,</hi> to let <hi>Mariana</hi> know the honour you do her, and I doubt not, but ſhe will write to you in Verſe with as much vigour as ſhe has done in Proſe.</p>
               <p>I render my humble thanks to Monſieur for his remembrance of his humble Servant. And I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you were not pleaſed to denote to me the things he ſaid, and his demands, ſeeing I take a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in executing his orders, being perſwaded he has more Friendſhip for me than I deſerve.</p>
               <p>I believe that you and the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ought to adjuſt the affair of the <hi>Palatine</hi> before parting, making her know that by the News you have received from <hi>Spain,</hi> you are

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59422:9"/>with your good will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to break off the commerce you hold with ſuch great deal of notice from abroad, inaſmuch as you cannot continue it without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me an irreparable injury. Tho' you be the moſt juſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable of all men, and that I need not doubt, but by this only motive you will grant me this favour; yet I will receive it as the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe you can beſtow on me for my ſmall ſervices; and I dare to ſay you owe it your ſelf in the preſent conjuncture, when you are on the point of ſetting forth, to execute a thing which does not at all agree with this commerce, which does you more injury, than if the Perſon in queſtion was at Court.</p>
               <p>Did you know how 'tis talkt of at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who accompany me, you would not need my entreaties.</p>

I beg your pardon, if I urge you to a thing which perhaps you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well reliſh; however, I entreat you to believe, that I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly part with my life, to have the happineſs of never propoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to you, but what you like, and what is ſuitable to your glory and intereſt.

               <p>I have entreated the Confident to communicate to you the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I wrote to him on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which touches me very nearly, ſeeing it concerns any reputation, and that of Perſons who are related to me, and eſpecially his own in the preſent conjuncture, as I have ſignified to him. I conjure you to aſſiſt me in this, that he may take the reſolution to which I humbly exhort him. I have not as yet had your anſwer to the Letter which I wrote to you from <hi>Poictiers</hi> on the return of the Currier from <hi>Spain,</hi> and I continue my Voyage in good health, and with a great deſire that <hi>Don Lewis</hi> may anſwer the ſincerity with which I go to confer with him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59422:11"/>conformably to the orders which the Confident and you have given me. I am greatly apprehenſive of the Engagements with the Prince for the future, and you may believe I will omit nothing to diſcover that matter. As to what remains, I think only of the time, in which I ſhall have the honour to ſee you, and the Confident, and I proteſt I have never more paſſionately deſired it. You will eaſily believe it, knowing all the reaſons obliging me hereto. It's already paſt Midnight, and I muſt part at two a Clock. I will end then in telling you, that the Members of the Parliament of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> being inform'd that I did not intend to paſs through their Town, have ſent me a Deputation, which I ſhall meet with to morrow at <hi>Libourn,</hi> although they have never done this before. I could have well diſpenſed with this Complement: Do not believe that this extraordinary civility does much elevate me, ſeeing that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59422:11"/>rude manner they uſed towards me heretofore at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in not viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, did not much depreſs me. Theſe are men of Conſcience, ſeeing they will now reſtore to me with intereſt, what they then thought not fit to pay me. I am entirely yours, and more the Confidents, and I intreat you to permit me, that I may aſſure Monſieur of my moſt humble reſpects.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MAgalotti</hi> has deliver'd me your Letter of the firſt of this Month; and I have not been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at what you write me touching
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59422:12"/>the Perſon, of whom I wrote to the Confident; for I am ſenſible that you know her, and that you are not capable of giving your affection to perſons who do not deſerve it. Neither have I ſo much as once imagin'd this could be; but I believ'd this would be bragg'd of, which is moſt true; and it concern'd your reputation that this report ſhould not have been, and that every one ſhould be undeceiv'd. Yet I am much oblig'd to you for the manner after which you write to me in this occaſion, aſſuring you that I am affected as I ought to be with all your favours towards me.</p>
               <p>The Confident has ſignified to me by her Letter of the <hi>1ſt</hi> Inſtant, that ſhe had not reaſon to be ſatisfied with you, in a certain occaſion, and refers me to what ſhe wrote at large the day before. Yet I have not receiv'd this Letter, and I am in the greateſt pain in the world on this account, and greatly troubled at the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which the Confident believes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59422:12"/>ſhe has receiv'd; though I cannot imagine the thing is of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For if this were, when I ſhould even die in the way, I would take Poſt to come where you are; but I cannot comprehend what this is, you having not done me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to inform me. I ſhall paſs my time ill, till I am ſatisfied in this point.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the Gold and Silver, I have explain'd my ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently thereon; but it has hapned that you have not underſtood my Letter; for it is another thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the working on Gold and Silver, and the ſuffering all the world to wear it, one having nothing common with the other. Here every body would be agreed, that the King and Monſieur ſhould wear it, and not others; yet you may do as you think fitting, and declare your will when you judge moſt proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pimentel</hi> parted this morning to meet Don <hi>Lewis.</hi> I would have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59422:13"/>to him your Preſents, which were very fine and rich, but he entreated me to keep them, till he has received Don <hi>Lewis.</hi> I have given him a Coach and Horſes, together with a Chariot and Horſes for his Servants; and have ordered the Governour of <hi>Gault</hi> to attend him, and defray his Charges till he comes to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, having thought this requiſite for your honour and ſervice. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to let the Confident know this.</p>
               <p>I ſend you a Bill to order <hi>Colbert</hi> to pay at <hi>Moüin</hi> a thouſand Piſtols, or eleven thouſand Livres. He will find this Sum, and greater, if your occaſions require; and be pleaſed to believe that having nothing but what is yours, you may diſpoſe of my poor Credit and Eſtate, and you cannot do me a greater pleaſure; all my happineſs conſiſting in giving you content, and gaining your good will.</p>

               <p>I Have received your Letter of the ſecond, and that of the Confident of the ſame date, touching which in my laſt I ſignified to you that I was in trouble; but they being come by the Ordinary, it was impoſſible I ſhould receive them ſooner.</p>
               <p>Should you not have commanded me ſo ſtrictly as you have done, to ſpeak to you with the greateſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the Matter concerns your ſervice, yet I muſt have done it in this occaſion, leſt I ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd the loſs of your favour.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59422:14"/>
               <p>I have read what the Confident wrote me touching your <hi>Chagrin,</hi> and the manner how you have dealt with her; but knowing, as I do, that the love which ſhe has for you is beyond all bounds, and that your good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as your duty, make you reſtleſs, as ſoon as you know you have diſpleaſed her; and that you immediately return to the teſtifying to her the greateſt tenderneſs; on this account I am not greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted; but I muſt tell you, that I am not a little afflicted to hear from all hands, how the world talks of you; in a time, when you were pleas'd to declare to me, that you were reſolv'd to apply your ſelf with all poſſible earneſtneſs to buſineſs, and to leave nothing undone where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you might become the greateſt Prince on Earth.</p>
               <p>The Letters of <hi>Paris, Flanders,</hi> and other parts ſay, that you cannot be known to be the ſame Perſon ſince my departure, and not becauſe of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59422:14"/>me, but on occaſion of ſome one that belongs to me; that you are in engagements which will hinder you from giving Peace to Chriſtendom, and to make your State and Subjects happy by your marriage; and that if to avoid ſo great a prejudice, you paſs on to make it, the Perſon whom you eſpouſe will be very miſerable, without being culpable.</p>
               <p>It's ſaid, and it is confirm'd by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Court, writ to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my Attendance, which you may one day know, as well as other Advices, when I ſhall have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be near your Perſon.</p>
               <p>It's ſaid then, that you are always ſhut up to write to the Perſon you love, and that you ſpend therein more time, than you did in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with her whilſt ſhe was at Court. 'Tis farther added, that I agree with you herein, and connive at this, to ſatisfie my Ambition, and hinder the Peace.</p>
               <p>It's ſaid, that you are at odds with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59422:15"/>the Queen, and thoſe who write in ſofteſt terms ſay, that you ſhun ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her as much as you can. I find moreover, that the complaiſance I have had for you, when you were urgent with me to ſend ſometimes News of you to this Perſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hers, ends in a continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of long Letters; which is to ſay, to write to her every day, and to receive an anſwer; ſo that the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier is always charged with as many Letters as there are days; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſcandal, nor even without blemiſhing the reputation of the Perſon and mine.</p>
               <p>And that which is worſe, is, that I am inform'd by the anſwers which the ſame Perſon has ſent me, when I would have adviſed her for her good, and by the adviſes which I have continually from <hi>Rochelle,</hi> that you omit nothing to engage her more and more, by aſſuring her that your intentions are to do for her ſuch things, which you know ought not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59422:15"/>to be, and which for ſeveral reaſons are impoſſible. Would to God that without wounding your reputation, you could diſcover your thoughts to others, and hear their anſwers, which from the higheſt to the loweſt in your Kingdom would ſo condemn them, as to cover you with great ſhame; and then I ſhould not find my ſelf in that ſad condition wherein I have lain, being not able to ſleep a wink, and knowing not what I do, my mind being ſo oppreſt with ſorrow, that I cannot give you ſo good an account of your affairs, as I have done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
               <p>God has eſtabliſht Kings (after what reſpects Religion, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of which they ought to do all things) for to watch for the good eaſe and preſervation of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and not to ſacrifice them to their particular Paſſions; and when ſuch unhappy Princes have appeared, they have been commonly abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Divine Providence, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59422:16"/>Hiſtories are full of the Revolutions and Miſeries which they have drawn down on their Perſons and States.</p>
               <p>And therefore I boldly admoniſh you not to heſitate any longer; and tho' you be the Maſter in a certain ſenſe to do what you pleaſe, yet you muſt give an account to God of your actions for ſaving your ſoul; and to the World for the ſaving your credit and reputation. For whatever you do they will judge of it as you give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to do whatever is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for your good and reputation; yet you muſt permit me to tell you, that writing in other terms to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> I know not what your intentions are: and in this doubtfulneſs I muſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, that the matter here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not only your honour and glory; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But in this caſe, ſhould your Subjects be ſo unhappy by your not taking the reſolution you ought; nothing in the World can hinder them from falling into greater miſeries than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and all Chriſtendom with them.</p>
               <p>And I can aſſure you, of my own knowledge, that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and many others, are on the Watch, waiting for the event of this, hoping, if things fall out according to their minds, to make good advantage of the plauſible pretence which you may give them; in which caſe this dangerous Prince will not fail to have the Parliament, the Grandees, and the Nobility of the Kingdom, and all the People favourable to him. Beſides that it would not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten loudly to be proclaimed, that I have been the adviſer and upholder of the Conduct you have hitherto held.</p>

Beſides I hold it for certain, that they will take at <hi>Madrid</hi> the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which we would take here in like caſe. And therefore I entreat you to conſider what bleſſings you may expect from God and Men, if for this we muſt begin again the bloodieſt War was ever known, and with the more prejudice, that we have carried away the advantages of late; that God has favoured your cauſe and the holy intentions which you and the Queen have ever had.</p>
               <p>I the more willingly declare this to you, in that <hi>Pimentel</hi> in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has intimated to me twice or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59422:17"/>thrice, that all the World ſays you are too amorous to marry ſo ſoon; and that the ſame thing was writ to him from <hi>Flanders</hi> in terms which gave him ſome diſquiet.</p>
               <p>I conclude all this diſcourſe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to you, that if I find not by the anſwer which I conjure you to make me with all ſpeed, that there is reaſon to hope you will return to a right mind, for your own good, for your honour, and the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kingdom, I have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe to take, to give you the laſt token of my fidelity, and zeal for your ſervice, than to remit into your hands all the benefits which it has pleaſed the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King, and you, and the Queen to heap upon me, and to embark my ſelf with my Family, to go and paſs the reſt of my days in ſome corner of <hi>Italy,</hi> and pray to God that this laſt Remedy may produce the cure which I wiſh more than all the things in the world; being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59422:18"/>to ſay, without exageration, and without uſing the terms of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and reſpect I owe, that there is no tenderneſs comparable to that which I have for you; and that it will be impoſſible for me not to dye with regret, ſhould I ſee you do any thing which may blacken your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expoſe your Perſon and State.</p>
               <p>I believe you know me well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to believe that whatever I write comes from the bottom of my heart, and that there is nothing which ſhall change my reſolution which I now denoted, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which you will make me, that you will henceforward begin a new courſe, and become Maſter of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which at preſent you are enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. You muſt do this, or make the two Perſons, whom you teſtifie to ſo greatly honour with your affection, to be ſeparated from you for ever, and to become the moſt unfortunate Wretches on Earth.</p>
               <p>The anſwer which you will make
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59422:18"/>me, will ſerve me likewiſe for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in what manner I ought to obſerve in the congreſs between <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and me in reference to the Marriage; for after all, your Honour and Conſcience will not ſuffer you to chuſe the moſt faithful of all your Servants, to aſſure the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of any thing which you will not inviolably obſerve.</p>
               <p>I ſignifie nothing of this to the Confident, it depends on you to communicate to her what I have writ to you, proteſting in the ſight of God, that you cannot do better than to follow her counſel, in the condition you are in, and to take up the reſolutions which God and all Chriſtendom expects from you. For it's certain, that if her life would procure your content, ſhe would willingly part with it, and therefore you are greatly to blame, if you imagine ſhe does not love you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe does not flatter you in certain things, which being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

               <p>MY pain being ſomewhat aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I take my Pen to tell you, that I have receiv'd your Letters of the <hi>16th. 20th.</hi> and <hi>22th.</hi> Inſtant, among which is the anſwer which you are pleaſed to make me to the diſpatch I ſent from <hi>Cadillac.</hi> You do me indeed the honour to tell me you are perſwaded that I ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59422:19"/>but your glory and the good of your State; and therefore you are reſolved to follow more than ever my advice; but at the ſame time you do the contrary. I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated you to write no more to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and you have anſwered me that would be too hard, and that the Confident had approved your reaſons; ſo that one may conclude, that I have ſome credit with you, and that you will follow my advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, provided they be according to your ſentiments. You ſpeak only at preſent of following thoſe of the Confident, becauſe they agree in ſome ſort with yours; and without explaining your ſelf more on my Letter from <hi>Cadillac,</hi> you give me exceſſive aſſurances of your good will and intentions, of following my counſels, yet without denoting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely your will in reſpect of what I ought to treat with <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> You conclude that you ſhall never more fail of following the counſels of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59422:20"/>Confident, and that you do not doubt but I approve this reſolution; this is in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> but a ſhifting of the queſtion, and a meer put off. You are the Maſter of your conduct, but not of obliging me to approve it, when I certainly know, that it is prejudicial to your Honour, to the good of your State, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Subjects. In fine, as I cannot commit a greater crime in your reſpect, than to diſguiſe things from you which concern your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſo I declare to you that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at reſt, nor ſatisfied, if I ſee not by the effects, that you make your ſelf Maſter of your ſelf; for without this, all is loſt, and the only remedy I am to practiſe, is to retire and to carry along with me the cauſe of the miſeries which are ready to happen.</p>
               <p>I have the ambition which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ought to have, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in certain particulars I paſs the bounds. I love my Niece very well; but without exageration, I love you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59422:20"/>yet more; and I more intereſt my ſelf in your Glory, and the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your State, than in all the things in the World. And therefore I cannot but repeat the things which I wrote to you from <hi>Cadillac;</hi> and though they be not agreeable to you at preſent, yet I am ſure you will love me for 'em another day, and have the goodneſs to acknowledge, that I never rendred you a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice than this.</p>
               <p>The Confident loves you with the greateſt tenderneſs, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her not to gratifie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, although ſhe knows they many times are diſagreeable to Reaſon; ſhe lets you proceed, becauſe ſhe is not able to ſee you out of humour. As to my part, I believe I have the ſame tenderneſs as the Confident, but this tenderneſs makes me harder, and more firm to oppoſe what is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt your reputation and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for ſhould I do otherwiſe, I ſhould be acceſſary to your ruine.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59422:21"/>
               <p>You are pleaſed to give your ſelf the trouble to tell me that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what I ſent you word was ſaid of you, and the commerce you had at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> but that neither you, nor the Confident, have heard any mention of it.</p>
               <p>This is not ſtrange that no body ſhould ſpeak to you about it; and for the Confident, ſhe cannot know what I know, but aſſuredly ſhe knows a great many things which ſhe does not tell you, that ſhe may not diſpleaſe you.</p>
               <p>I wiſh would Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> could dare to tell you the diſcourſe held on your occaſion, and then you would ſee I advance nothing of my own head. In fine, I reply to you, that all <hi>Europe</hi> talks of the paſſion you have, and that every body ſpeaks of it with that liberty as is prejudicial to us. Even at <hi>Madrid</hi> the buſineſs is known, for they have not failed to write it from <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> with intention to break the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59422:21"/>project of the Alliance which is in hand, to hinder the execution of the Peace.</p>
               <p>When I ſhall have the honour to ſee you, I will ſhew you Papers which will diſcover to you far more than what I have wrote. If you remedy not this without delay, the affair will every day grow worſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incurable.</p>

               <p>I Have retain'd this Currier in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the anſwer of Mr. <hi>de Lionne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>de Pimentel,</hi> to the end I may inform you of what they bring from <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our enterview.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed then to let the King and Queen know, that nothing could be added to the Civility which <hi>Don Lewis</hi> ſhewed me. He has moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver writ me a very obliging Letter, and ſignified to me, that if my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper continued, he would come and ſee me as far as <hi>Bayonne;</hi> and farther, that he was content to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me, firſt in <hi>France,</hi> paſſing croſs the River which ſeparates the two Kingdoms; but this being a thing

               <p>I could not well approve openly of his ſending into <hi>Spain</hi> for this, but Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel</hi> ſilenc'd me, in ſaying, that if this gave me any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, Don <hi>Lewis</hi> would come this very day to ſee me, without waiting the anſwer from <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing theſe Gentlemen do not haſten, and experience ſhewing me they do nothing by hazard, I therefore believe it my duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the King and Queen that I may make an halt three or four days at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> under pretence of reſting my

               <p>I Have already inform'd you, that we have in a manner agreed, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould give me the firſt viſit, and that afterwards I would return his at

                  <hi>Hiron,</hi> or <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and that he will build a great Houſe in an Iſle, which ſeparates the two Kingdoms, where the Conferences will be held; but having ſeen, that this Affair would hold long, he pretending not to enter on buſineſs in the two firſt viſits, which I have Collected from ſome words which Don <hi>Antonio Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel</hi> has utter'd; That Don <hi>Lewis</hi> might be ſick when I gave him a viſit; and that moreover the world might find fault, that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhould be held in a place, which might be reſpected as Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Houſe, becauſe 'twas he that built it, though in a neutral place.</p>
               <p>All theſe Reaſons, I ſay, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of abridging the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as much as may be, made me adviſe yeſterday morning with all our Gentlemen, and reſolve to tell Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel,</hi> that I thank Don <hi>Lewis</hi> for his civility in offering to make me the firſt viſit; and that being reſponſible, as we are, to all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59422:24"/>Chriſtendom, for the moments we tarried to enjoy the effects of the peace, I therefore judg'd it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to retrench the firſt viſits and without any more delay we cauſe Bridges to be made, to paſs each of us on his ſide into the Iſle, where might be equal Lodgings built, and a Chamber at the head of the Iſle, in an equal diſtance from the two Lodgings, in which there may be two doors, one on his ſide, and the other on mine, by which we may enter, taking both of us our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſeats which ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from each party in the midſt of the Chamber, which we ſhall take care to build, and furniſh each of us half; whereby we ſhall avoid the inconveniencies which Don <hi>Lewis</hi> apprehends, if my Train and his could commodiouſly land, becauſe there might be Orders given to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport only a certain number of the moſt qualified perſons into the Iſland, and of whoſe behaviour there would

There being no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the execution of what's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, <hi>Pimentel</hi> having on his part ſpoke conformably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and being ſet out yeſterday in all haſte to carry the whole matter to Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> ſo I have ſet forth this morning at break of day the Sieurs <hi>de Chouppes,</hi> and <hi>de Sevigny,</hi> with five or ſix able Perſons, and about forty Carpenters, to work inceſſantly at the Bridge and Building, which muſt be made in concert with the Officers of Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> and I have moreover ſent for this effect twenty Waggons laden with Timber, and if they work day and night as I have given Order, I believe our firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be held on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next, or the next day at fartheſt.</p>
               <p>Monſieur the Marechal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who went this Morning to view the place, has related to me, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been Projected, may be eaſily executed.</p>

               <p>For my part, I acknowledge to you that I am not able to believe that any perſon whatever can be ſo baſe; and I dare affirm Don <hi>Lewis</hi> is not capable of having ſuch a thought, and that if any one ſhould dare to propoſe ſuch a treacherous project, he would very ill reſent it; but there's no need of ſaying any more of this. I entreat you to impart all this to the King and Queen, and to believe that you have not a more faithful Friend.</p>

               <p>I Continually torment my ſelf, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all diligence to haſten the happy day, in which Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and I ſhall ſee one another; but yet I cannot vanquiſh the ſlowneſs with which theſe Gentlemen proceed.</p>
               <p>I was in hopes we might have ſeen one another this day, and I ſent Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this effect, but you will ſee what he ſaid to me yeſterday night by the Copy of the Letter which I ſend you.</p>
               <p>This morning <hi>Chouppes</hi> came here to confirm me the ſame thing, we muſt have patience whether we will or not.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59422:26"/>
               <p>Yet I receive mighty obliging complements every day from Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who ſignifies to me that he will yield to me in every thing, ſo earneſt is he to begin the conference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pimentel</hi> came as from him the other day, and I have agreed with him about the ſmalleſt circumſtances which are to be done on one ſide and the other, when we ſhall ſee one another; which is to ſay, of the number of the Guards which we are to bring, the Perſons which ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us in the Iſle, to remain there during the time of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and even to the ſort of Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries which are to be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Room.</p>
               <p>I have no difficulty to agree about theſe trifles, I tell him that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> or my reputation will receive no harm, when the Hangings and Carpets of one, ſhould not be ſo rich as thoſe of the other, ſeeing it's well known we have Maſters, who have given us means enough to have the beſt.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59422:27"/>
               <p>I ſaid likewiſe that if I believ'd I could make Chriſtendom enjoy the happineſs of the Peace a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour ſooner, by leaving naked all the Walls of my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there is nothing in the World I would more gladly do.</p>
               <p>In fine, we muſt ſometimes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves to the infirmities of others, but I can tell you, that if I loved oſtentation, I have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſatisfie my ſelf, ſeeing I have certainly better Tapeſtry, and in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quantity than Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> I have far more people than he of all kinds, which is to ſay, more Domeſticks, more Guards, and more perſons who accompany me, and I believe there will be at leaſt thirty Coaches with ſix Horſes which will follow me the day I go to the Conference.</p>
               <p>They have deſired there might be boards put up all along to the point of the Iſle, to the end there may be no communication between thoſe who accompany me, and thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59422:27"/>who ſhall come with Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> which I have liked well; for there's danger, leſt by the indiſcretion of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there might ariſe ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and whatever care might have been otherwiſe taken, it is impoſſible but our <hi>French</hi> would have ſcofft at the cloſe Breeches, of which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> have already doubted. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there's as much reaſon to laugh at the largeneſs of ours, and we might eaſily reckon our ſelves eaven hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remember they have been greatly derided in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. and Don <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>Caſtile</hi>

               <p>I Cannot tell what to ſay of theſe lingrings, and it's a trouble to me to ſee how the World murmurs at it. Had the Chamber of the Conference been undertaken as I would have had it, I might have ſeen <hi>Don Lewis</hi> two days after; for all the reſt is needleſs, I having for my part offered to meet him with one only Valet. There's no body in <hi>Europe</hi> but has his eyes turn'd that way, and I am certain by what's written from ſeveral parts, that theſe reaſons are ill interpreted. You know on what reſolution I parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> and it being agreed that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59422:30"/>the interview ſhould be in a Church at <hi>Paris;</hi> every one therefore belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it would not have been deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Moment.

               <p>It's needleſs to urge you to haſten them to put an end to this affair, for the thing it ſelf ſpeaks ſufficiently, and it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59422:30"/>ſeems to me, that <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and I ſhould merit more from the hands of God and Men, if we appear'd each of us only with one Gentleman without any ſtate, ſeeing that all our Pomp contributes nothing to the buſineſs in hand.

               <p>For without this, the King would not have yielded ſo many points, and oſpecially in a time, wherein the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Affairs, and the ſtrength of his Arms, might make him expect freſh and greater advantages in the continuation of the War.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59422:32"/>
               <p>And you well know, that I have convinced you ſeveral times, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s intention could be no other, when he ſent Monſieur <hi>Pimentel</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> than to make the overture of the Marriage without renunciation, in the time when there was but one Prince in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> believe, as it is true, that there is not a greater Match in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> than that of the Infanta; ſo it is to be ſuppoſed, that they will grant that there is not a more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than that of the King.</p>
               <p>Let me entreat you then to take occaſion to ſpeak to the ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Coloma</hi> on this matter, under pretence of having made reflection on what he has ſeveral times told you, that the contract of the Queen ought to regulate this; for this will better make known to us the intentions they have on this particular; and give occaſion to Don <hi>Lewis</hi> to ſpeak to me of it, after which I ſhall be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59422:33"/>better able to penetrate into other things.</p>
               <p>I am obliged to tell you, that it is the temper of Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> not to reſolve ſo ſoon in Affairs, but to ſpin 'em out as long as poſſible. And therefore we muſt be careful to preſs him inceſſantly, and make known to him by means of the Sieur <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loma,</hi> that it is not for his reputation nor mine, to loſe time fruitleſly in adjuſting things, which might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ended with equity and a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be to morrow at Noon, without fail, at the Conference, as I have appointed with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> and knowing not whether you are determin'd to come to night, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to do it, if you can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great inconvenience.</p>

               <p>TO begin this Letter, I muſt tell you that the Conference I had on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt with Don <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> which has been the econd, laſted near four hours and a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59422:34"/>half. Several of thoſe points were examin'd, which are remitted to be adjuſted here, and we agreed in the greateſt part, of which a Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum was made, to be kept by us in writing. Don <hi>Lewis</hi> having named to do this with Monſieur <hi>de Lionne,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Pedro Coloma</hi> Secretary of State, whom he brought with him, Monſieur <hi>Pimentel</hi> has much reſented it, and with reaſon, ſeeing that after he had the happineſs to conclude and ſign the Peace at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhould be excluded from the Negotiation, and another put in his place. On which I will make a ſmall digreſſion to their Majeſties, in that <hi>Lainet</hi> having vaunted on the mortification given to the Sieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> would have it believ'd that his ſacrifice had no other end, than the ſatisfaction of Monſieur the Prince, by reaſon he was too quick in promiſing what I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him to his prejudice. I thought I ought not to refrain ſaying a word hereupon to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59422:34"/>in ſuch a manner, as might do no wrong to <hi>Pimentel,</hi> and which might neither occaſion Don <hi>Lewis</hi> to believe that I took it ill he ſhould make uſe of one Miniſter rather than another.</p>
               <p>I told him then, that I had a great curioſity to know whether he was ſatisfied with the Conduct of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> he having reaſon to queſtion it, ſeeing this Gentleman receiv'd not the publick marks of his eſteem and affection: That as I ſhould be ridiculous, if I concern'd my ſelf about the Miniſters he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, or if I examin'd why he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thoſe with whom I thought he ſhould be content, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being Maſter of his own Subjects, and Miniſters; yet I was intereſſed in the ill treatment of Monſieur <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel,</hi> by reaſon that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Agents publiſhed, that this was done, not only becauſe that he had proceeded beyond the Orders at <hi>Paris,</hi> touching the Intereſt of this Prince, but moreover by reaſon that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59422:35"/>the Senior Don <hi>Lewis</hi> believ'd he could not give to the ſaid Prince a greater mark of his cordial friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than in ſacrificing <hi>Pimentel,</hi> who had ſo ſucceſsfully ſerv'd in an an Affair of ſo great importance, and becauſe I had an eſteem for him, and conſider'd him as my friend.</p>
               <p>I paſt further on to tell him, that the principal Motive which had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to talk by word of mouth with him on this frontier, having been not only to commence a ſincere and perfect friendſhip between our Maſters and the two Crowns; but moreover to eſtabliſh a ſtrict Correſpondence between him and me, as I had been inform'd he had deſired on his ſide; but I loſt the hope this could ever be, if it were true he preferr'd the friendſhip of Monſieur the Prince to mine, as it appear'd in what paſt in relation to the Sieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> and which <hi>Lainet</hi> publiſhed with ſuch care and oſtentation. For this being ſo, I need not take on my ſelf the trouble
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59422:35"/>for the time to come, to confirm this friendſhip, ſeeing there is no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of attaining it. So that I had great reaſon to regret my journey and that of his Excellency; ſeeing all the principal points of the peace ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Sign'd, and Concluded at <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the reſt being eaſily terminated, our interview (which in my regard had no other object than this union between us, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the quiet of Chriſtendom) would remain fruitleſs, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Monſieur the Prince bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an invincible obſtacle to the end I propoſed.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed much concern'd at what I told him on the ſubject of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and declared to me with great heat, that by all ſorts of reaſons he preferr'd mine before that of the Prince, praying me to hear a recital of the manner he had uſed with Mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> having earneſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelf to give him, before all the world, all poſſible marks of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59422:36"/>and eſteem, not only becauſe he loved him, but becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in him, more than all his other qualities, the happineſs he had of being in my favour; that he would not have ſhewed ſuch a great overſight as to mortifie Monſieur <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel,</hi> becauſe I eſteem'd him, and by this means to pleaſe Monſieur the Prince; that he was not obliged to anſwer for the diſcourſes of <hi>Lainet,</hi> who ſpake without grounds, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own fancy; that he wiſht he could ſerve Monſieur the Prince; but by juſt means, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by the entreaties he made me, to uſe my utmoſt endeavours with the King, to procure him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more advantagious in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, than what had been offer'd at <hi>Paris;</hi> that he never thought of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Monſieur <hi>Pimentel</hi> from this Negotiation; his intention having been on the contrary, to employ him more than ever; but that being likewiſe obliged to make uſe of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59422:36"/>Secretary of State, whom the King his Maſter had expreſly ſent with him as an old experienc'd Miniſter; and who had all the Papers from whence might be drawn the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notices to give the laſt ſtroke, as well to the making of the Peace as the Marriage, he could not therefore but make uſe of him, yet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he ſhould labour jointly with <hi>Pimentel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it not having been poſſible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Mr. <hi>Pimentel</hi> to yield to him the firſt place, he could not ſee how they could act together, ſeeing that the Sieur <hi>Coloma</hi> by his Age, by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Secretary of Sate, and by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s ſending him here, to labour at what there is to do, ought to paſs firſt.</p>
               <p>And after having ſaid a thouſand obliging things, and teſtified that he wiſht for nothing more in the world than my Friendſhip; becauſe he was perſwaded of the ſame things I had told him, and by the great eſteem he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59422:37"/>had for my perſon, he concluded, That if I would have him deal other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in relation to <hi>Pimentel,</hi> he would do it, and did not doubt but to make it be approved by his Maſter.</p>
               <p>I anſwered all his offers with the civility I ought, and declared to him, that being aſſured of his Friendſhip, I was not ſo ill adviſed as to pretend he ſhould make uſe of other Miniſters, than thoſe he ſhould judge fitting, becauſe as to my regard they were all equal, ſeeing that I was aſſured of his good intentions, and that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the orders he ſhould give them, all would paſs well.</p>
               <p>I the rather made you a particular relation of what paſt on this point, becauſe it was very nice, and that I believed I might draw a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in all Negotiations for the time to come, by the diſcourſes I have had hereupon with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> in whoſe mind I think I have imprinted, that my complaint was chiefly grounded on the fear I had, leſt his Friendſhip
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59422:37"/>for the Prince, ſhould hinder that which he ſhould have for me, and which I judged neceſſary for the good of our Maſters, their Subjects, and the quiet of all Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>And I begin already to ſee the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects I hoped for; ſeeing Monſieur <hi>de Lionne,</hi> whom I have ſent to <hi>Andaye</hi> to labour with the Sieur <hi>Coloma,</hi> to reduce into writing the points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and I, ſends me word, that he meets with all the facility I told him of, in labouring with the ſaid Sieur <hi>Coloma,</hi> not only becauſe he believ'd him well intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, but becauſe he ſtudies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that we ſhall have no leſs occaſion to be ſatisfied with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct than that of Monſieur <hi>Pimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We accorded in this Conference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preamble of the Treaty, which was one of the things which I had agreed upon with Mr. <hi>Pimentel</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to remit here at my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with Don <hi>Lewis.</hi> And having
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59422:38"/>found by his diſcourſe that he was not over fond in giving to the Pope any ſhare in the concluſion of the Peace, ſeeing that in effect the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of his Holineſs had no ways cooperated therein, and that he had gone ſo far as to ſay, that we muſt not deprive our Maſters of the glory which was due to them, in having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the neceſſary ſteps to conclude ſpeedily the Peace which God had inſpired into them: I was very glad to let him fall into the matter, to the end the propoſition of making only mention in the preamble, of the King, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> might come wholly from him. Having thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards urged me to tell him what I thought on the manner after which we ſhould draw up this preamble, I told him, that I was wholly of his opinion, not to take from our Kings the merit of having, by a Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, given quiet to Chriſtendom; and added, that as nothing ought to have contributed more to this, than
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59422:38"/>the prayers of the Pope, ſo were his name inſerted, all the World would have attributed the greateſt part of the work to his endeavours. And ſo this point was adjuſted to both our contents.</p>
               <p>We ſpake likewiſe of ſeveral other things of ſmall conſequence, and of which for the moſt part the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries of the two Kings were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and I entreated to haſten buſineſs, that Mr. <hi>Lionne</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Coloma</hi> might reduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to writing theſe kind of things in which there could be no eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; beſides that we might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards examine them together, to ſee whether there was any thing to be added or diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>He liked alſo, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to work on the Articles of the Marriage, having made him ſenſible, that if we diſpatcht not this point, there were ſo many things which were to precede it, that we ſhould find our ſelves ſtraitned for time, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59422:39"/>Seaſon advancing apace, and it being likely to be incommodious to every body, if we deferr'd beyond the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>October,</hi> the execution of what had been determined hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Taking occaſion from the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the haſtning the time for the accompliſhment of this Marriage, I told him that the King was reſolved to ſend, as is cuſtomary, a perſon of Quality to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to demand the Sereniſſima Infanta, but ſeeing he that ſhould be deſigned for this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice would ſpend a great deal of time in making his Equipage, and that what diligence ſoever he uſed, every thing could not be ready till the Month of <hi>September,</hi> I therefore took the boldneſs to propoſe to him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Catholick King could agree, that I ſhould make this demand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring I had orders to go as far as <hi>Madrid,</hi> and if I did not do it, 'twas the goodneſs of his Catholick Majeſty, who had ſpared me the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59422:39"/>trouble of ſo long a journey.</p>
               <p>He immediately anſwer'd me, that he wiſht this were done in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I mention'd, and that he would write about it the moſt favourably he could to the King his Maſter, but that to ſpeak ſincerely to me, he did not believe the Council would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this deſign, knowing the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> was ſent there here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and that the appearances were in ſome ſort neceſſary in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this nature.</p>
               <p>He only added, that to abridge the time, in caſe the propoſition I made him, was not approved at <hi>Madrid,</hi> there would be no inconveniency in the King's ſending as it were in Poſt, him that he ſhould chuſe for this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, who ſhould be thus diſpens'd with, for making the preparations of an Embaſſador; againſt which no body could ſay any thing, becauſe every one might ſee that it was for expedition that this courſe was taken, for otherwiſe it would be impoſſible
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59422:40"/>to do it within the time; theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials and Ceremonies not at all regarding the Eſſence of the thing.</p>
               <p>I endeavoured, after the diſcourſe I had with him, to penetrate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>Spain</hi> deſign'd to come as far as the Frontiers, telling him how greatly the Queen would rejoyce to ſee and embrace him, as ſhe had ſeveral times teſtified to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> when at <hi>Paris.</hi> To which he anſwer'd me, That if the Queen deſir'd it, the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would willingly undertake the journey, having no leſs tenderneſs for her, than ſhe had for him; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demanded of him, if I might aſſure her Majeſty of it, he told me I might. But though he ſpake to me in theſe terms, the advices which I have, and which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me by the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons about Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſay, that although the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is not really ſick, yet he has a kind of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59422:40"/>Palſie in his arm, which will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to expoſe himſelf to the fatigue of ſo long a journey, whence he cannot return, but in the winter, ſo that there cannot be any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this, whatever is ſaid by Don <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſignifies not much that he will in this diſguiſe what he knows, and when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall find out ſome pretence to excuſe himſelf from the journey, in the time when he has made himſelf expected, this will alter nothing, nor retard one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the execution of what has been agreed. And I ſend you this notice only, that their Majeſties may know to the full what Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has ſaid to me touching this matter, and the different advices I have elſewhere. But their Majeſties will be ſurpriſed, when they know, that notwithſtanding whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has paſt in reference to Monſieur the Prince, in the firſt Conference, wherein I had ſo well anſwer'd the reaſons that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had alledg'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59422:41"/>to me, to oblige me to obtain for the Prince ſomething more than what had been agreed on at <hi>Paris,</hi> that I believ'd he would never have ſpoke more of it. Yet Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd again to the charge at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of <hi>Lainet,</hi> who had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him new reaſons.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs to tell you whatever has paſt; but their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties are to know that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied on this ſubject with greater ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs than I did at the firſt time, and that I have put Don <hi>Lewis</hi> out of a condition of conteſting any more hereupon.</p>
               <p>And telling me in the heat of the diſcourſe, that it was very hard, that we would not conſent the Catholick King ſhould give Monſieur the Prince a Recompence proportionable to the ſervices which he had rendred him, and the loſſes he had ſuffered in <hi>France,</hi> wherein the reputation of his Majeſty was the more concern'd, that he had promiſed by a Treaty
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59422:41"/>with this Prince, not to make a Peace till he was entirely re-eſtabliſht in whatever he had then when he entred into the Party of <hi>Spain;</hi> which was followed with other reaſons of this nature: I replied, without being moved, That if he took the pains to ſet down in writing the reaſons he had alledg'd to me with ſuch great earneſtneſs, I would ſign them on my ſide as the only ones which ſhould hinder me from conſenting to what was propoſed in favour of Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that he had mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged to perſwade me, that the King might the rather acquieſce in the ſatisfying Monſieur the Prince, in that he had no other intention than to ſerve faithfully his Majeſty all the reſt of his days, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by this means the honour of his good will; I told him therefore, that ſuppoſing this were as true, as it was dubious, conſidering how this Prince had dealt with his Majeſty,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59422:42"/>who had heapt on him ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; yet his Majeſty, and all thoſe who had the honour to be of his Council, would be accuſed of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhould they confide again in the promiſes of this Prince. And for concluſion, I told Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> that ſeeing he ſhewed ſuch paſſion for the Prince's intereſts, I reſolved on my ſide to contribute thereto, in humbly entreating his Majeſty to approve of a propoſition which I would offer to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> by means of which the ſaid Prince would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain far greater advantages than thoſe he pretends to.</p>
               <p>He heard this with great joy, ſhewing great impatience to know what I would mention to him in this matter; I told him then, I would beſeech the King to re-eſtabliſh Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince and his Son, in all the Offices and Governments, which they had before the ſaid Prince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that in exchange
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59422:42"/>of the places which were raiſed, they ſhould have others given them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Catholick Majeſty would leave <hi>Portugal</hi> as it was, which would end the War on all ſides.</p>
               <p>I never faw him ſo moved as he appeared in this occaſion, wherein all the heat of his body appeared in his face. He told me there was a great deal of difference between the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> and Monſieur the Prince; to which I replied, that he ſaid true, for one was in poſſeſſion of two Kingdoms, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had nothing. In fine, he far rejected this propoſition, alledging to me ſeveral other things, which, as you may believe, were not heard without reply. After which I told him, that I would not let <hi>Lainet</hi> have any knowledge of this overture, which, though it was rejected by his Excellency as impracticable, yet would give occaſion to this man to importune him in the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his Maſter.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59422:43"/>
               <p>I knew I might boldly make this propoſition without apprehending to be taken at my word, ſeeing that moreover this would be a means to demonſtrate to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> what a ready diſpoſition the King ſhewed for Peace, and of what conſequence the point of <hi>Potugal</hi> was, which his Majeſty had yielded at my humble ſupplication, and to re-eſtabliſh Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince in ſo many places, Offices, and Governments, provided the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> might remain a peaceable Poſſeſſor of what is at preſent in his Obedience.</p>
               <p>And Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſpeaking to me continually of the great advantages which the King would draw from this Peace, reckoning up all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Provinces which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his Majeſty's hands; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways helpt my ſelf out, by telling him, that this was not to be put in the ballance with the releaſe which we made on the Article of <hi>Portugal,</hi> although by other reaſons,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59422:43"/>which I would not let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> know the thing is not in effect ſuch, as I endeavoured to make it appear.</p>
               <p>Here is all I judg'd fit to write to you to make known to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, to whom it's fit to declare likewiſe, that God deſigns not only to have a peace between theſe two great Potentates, but moreover to take away the averſion which has always had ſuch firm root between theſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>For whereas Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and I were equally afraid there ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſome quarrel between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our Train, during the courſe of the Conferences, they live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if they had for many years contracted a firm Friendſhip between one another, which does not appear ſtrange between Perſons of rank; but to ſee on both ſides, from the moſt conſiderable, even to the Grooms and Lacqueys, that there ſhould be an emulation who ſhould be moſt civil, and treat one another
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59422:44"/>moſt friendly; this is a thing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that it is no marvel if we be greatly ſurpriſed with it.</p>
               <p>Every day of the Conference I take care to provide Collations; and this produces a good effect, for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Conference, all the great Ones of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſons of Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Train, come and drink in my Appartment; and thoſe which belong to me go into that of Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, where they are likewiſe very well entertained. To morrow Monſieur the Mareſchal of <hi>Gramont</hi> makes a great Feaſt at <hi>Andaye</hi> to the principal Lords who accompany Don <hi>Lews.</hi> So that you ſee that the great Affairs in hand hinder not theſe Gentlemen from making good chear.</p>

               <p>I Wrote to you Yeſterday by a Currier whom the Chevalier de <hi>Caderouſſe</hi> ſent me; and I defer the writing to their Majeſties what paſt in the laſt Conference till the return of the King's Footman.</p>
               <p>Before I enter on any other matter,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59422:46"/>let me entreat you to keep ſecret what I wrote to you touching the Biſhoprick of <hi>Apt;</hi> for the King will be perhaps obliged to have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for the firſt Preſident of the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi> who requeſts it for his Brother, than for what I am to repreſent thereupon to his Majeſty. However, if he thinks fit, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Affair may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till my return to <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> tho' I very much apprehend this will not be ſo ſoon as I wiſh for, and judge fitting. You will know the reaſons of this fear, and what I do likewiſe to haſten the concluſion of this Affair.</p>
               <p>This laſt Conference held above Five hours, and, in a word, there has been nothing at all determined in it; for Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſpent the greateſt part of the time in making me entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and uſed all imaginable means to oblige me to conſent, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould give to Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur the Prince a Recompence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the great loſſes he had fuſtained in his ſervice.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59422:46"/>
               <p>Their Majeſties will eaſiy believe that I was not much moved with Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s earneſt entreaties; but being on the contrary weary with hearing ſo much ſaid on one Affair, on which I had before declared to him what I could do, and it ſeeming to me that he was much to blame to loſe fruitleſly a time ſo precious, which ſhould be employed in giving the laſt ſtroke to the Treaty of Peace which had been already Concluded, Signed, and Ratified; I made him therefore plainly underſtand that I came perſwaded that we ſhould not ſpend Three Hours time in agreeing about all points which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be adjuſted here; but yet I ſaw that we had loſt Fifteen in Three Conferences, and that when he ſhould ſpeak to me an Hundred times on the buſineſs of Monſieur the Prince, I could never return him any new Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Phlegmatick Humour of his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59422:47"/>Nation, is naturally ſlow and irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and as far as I can ſee, it's no difficult matter to divert him from concluding an Affair, when he is ſhewn any difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>It's no hard matter to diſcern what is purely his own, and what is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him by others; for I know very well, that in the Two firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and even in this laſt, he was partly perſwaded by my Reaſons, and that he had nothing to expect in behalf of Monſieur the Prince: Yet he always returned fortified with what <hi>Lainet</hi> and the other Adherents of this Prince have told him. I know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he has receiv'd Letters from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to preſs him hereupon, and perhaps theſe Perſons have perſwaded him that I would yield at laſt to his Inſtances.</p>
               <p>I ſee him then furiouſly haraſs'd by what <hi>Lainet</hi> and others tell him, by the Letters which Monſieur the Prince writes him, and by the good Offices which <hi>Caracene</hi> and the other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59422:47"/>
                  <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers, whoſe Intereſt is to hinder the Peace, do for him with Don <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do I doubt but it has been ſuggeſted to him, That holding out, he will compaſs all; and that rather than I ſhould return with the rupture of the Peace, I will conſent to what ever he would have me.</p>
               <p>It's moreover certain that whatever the <hi>French,</hi> partakers with Monſieur the Prince, or engaged in his ſervice, write here to <hi>Lainet,</hi> and to the Prince in <hi>Flanders,</hi> is lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> and eſpecially what <hi>Croiſy</hi> has ſent ſeveral times to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which is to ſay, That Don <hi>Lewis</hi> holding out will obtain for the Prince more than he deſires, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe a greater Misfortune can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen to me than not to finiſh the Treaty of Peace, by the ill effect which this would produce in the minds of all People, who would be able to procure my Ruine, ſeeing it would be no hard matter to perſwade
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59422:48"/>the World, that I had been the cauſe of this rupture, and all the evils with which it would be apparently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; but becauſe he farther knows, it being confirm'd to him by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Perſons well inform'd of the preſent State of the Kingdom, of the impoſſibility of raiſing Money, of which I am as ſenſible as any one, on which account I cannot imagine to continue the War; and ſo much the rather, that I alſo know the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals are ready, in caſe of a rupture, to break out upon me.</p>
               <p>I know, as having ſeen them, that there have been ſeveral Memoirs ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> to Monſieur to Prince, who has ſent them by an expreſs Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to <hi>Lainet,</hi> tending all of 'em to oblige Don <hi>Lewis</hi> to ſtand firm in what reſpects Monſieur the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to inſinuate, that ſhould he be obliged to continue the War, every thing would change for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Prince being interreſſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59422:48"/>that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould thus believe, it's not to be doubted but he ſends him word that <hi>England</hi> will be for them, That he has great Parties in <hi>France</hi> who will act ſtrenuouſly for him, if the Peace be not made. But if he can oblige Don <hi>Lewis</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the War, I hope he will find things in a different poſture than that wherein they have been repreſented to him; and that the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> will thereby receive the prejudice.</p>
               <p>I obſerve to you, whatever may make Don <hi>Lewis</hi> hold the Conduct he does, to the end their Majeſties may ſee that I have not only his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to combate with, but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Spirit of all ill <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who from ſeveral Reaſons hinder the finiſhing of a Work which deſtroys all their hopes of troubling the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and puts them out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſhew themſelves.</p>
               <p>I will now paſs to the informing you, the moſt ſuccinctly as I can, of the moſt eſſential matters which Don
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59422:49"/>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> propoſed to me in this laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in relation to Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>He took great care to exaggerate the Paſſion which Monſieur the Prince had to acquire my good will, which he as much valued as the greateſt Place which could be given him; That he knew this Prince ſpake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſincerely; That he could ſhew it me by a private Advice he had received hereupon ſince Twenty Four Hours; and that if I would he would make him come Poſt here with only Two Gentlemen, as he himſelf deſired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured that if we came to the Speech of one another, we ſhould not depart without mutual ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thus all would be ended.</p>
               <p>I rejected this Propoſition, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe for this of reaſons which may eaſily come into any Man's mind; and I declared to him in very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms, that I found no difficulty in my ſelf of giving my Friendſhip to Monſieur the Prince with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſincerity; promiſing that if this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59422:49"/>Prince did what he ought, in reference to the King, there would be no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nor Friends in <hi>France</hi> from whom he might expect more marks of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Kindneſs than from me: And I likewiſe told him, That I would willingly give him a Blank on this condition for Monſieur the Prince to write his own terms hereupon; but that with all the Proteſtations and un-interreſſedneſs which the Prince ſhew'd, I intreated his Excellency to permit me to tell him, That having treated for Ten or Twelve Years with him, I muſt better know his Humour than his Excellency, who knew him only by the Letters he received from him, by the relations of the Agents and Adherents of this Prince, and by the Conduct he had held for a certain time; That having all his hope in the Protection which his Excellency promiſed him from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he muſt be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent if he had not held a very ſubmiſſive carriage, very complaiſant, and in fine, ſuch a one as is neceſſary

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59422:51"/>to beget a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>I added, That by this particular knowledge which I had of Monſieur the Prince, I might tell him in the firſt place, That his Excellency would find himſelf much wearied, were he to endure all the Importunities of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince when he ſhould be near him; and that, in truth, he would little value my Friendſhip, ſhould it not preſently produce to him in ſome ſort or other the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he ſollicites; and that I was ſure his Excellency knew this as well as I.</p>
               <p>It was then he replied to me, <hi>Would you have a Prince of his Merit return into</hi> France <hi>without Reputation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Places, Offices, or Governments? How will you have him live?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I briskly anſwer'd him, As Five Hundred other Princes of the Blood, who without attempting any thing againſt the King and the State, have yet never had any Government or Offices; That moſt of the Princes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59422:51"/>of the Blood only deſiring them to do miſchief, there is therefore great reaſon not to give 'em them: For their ſecurity, and the receiving marks of reſpect from all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> they need only to live well, and ſerve the King faithfully, as they are hereunto obliged more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects.</p>
               <p>Here he offered me a Thouſand Flatteries, and ſaid to me, <hi>Seeing you are not willing we ſhould give Mounſteur the Prince Places in Soveraignty, can I not at leaſt obtain from the King to give him ſome State, as the Two</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrias, <hi>or the Kingdom of</hi> Sardaignia?</p>
               <p>I told him, I ſcarce believ'd him in earneſt, and that he dexterouſly made me theſe Offers, to ſhew the Prince's Followers the deſire the King his Maſter had to do great things for him, knowing well 'twould coſt him nothing in the end, there being no likelihood that the King would conſent that the Prince ſhould, having this Eſtabliſhment, return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59422:52"/>
                  <hi>France:</hi> To which I yet added, That if Monſieur the Prince, taken with the Preſent of a Kingdom, would receive it from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> I would conſent to it. He replied to me, That in this caſe Monſieur the Duke <hi>D'Anguienne</hi> might return into <hi>France,</hi> to keep there the place of his Father, and enjoy whatever the King ſhould conſent to reſtore to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince. But I replied to him, That herein the Father and Son were the ſame, and that ſuch a kind of diviſion would be, on a thouſand accounts, prejudicial to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and I concluded, that his Excellency muſt reſolve to give ſome conſiderable Sum of Money to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, with which he might buy a conſiderable Eſtate in Land, which would remain to him and his Heirs for ever, and would be more advantagious than Places which he muſt loſe when he dyed.</p>
               <p>But he likes not this, ſaying, That if they gave him Money, 'twould be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59422:52"/>a Gratification, and not a Recompence for the Services he had done, and what he had loſt in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the heat of the Diſcourſe he was ſo tranſported as to ſay. That his Maſter would have no Allies, after the Promiſes he had made to Monſieur the Prince, ſhould he abandon him, and ſuffer him to be ſtript of whatever might render him, and had heretofore rendred him conſiderable to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwerd him Three things. The Firſt, That Subjects who revolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King, and put themſelves under the protection of another, ſhould never be term'd Allies, becauſe this term is only applicable to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes, who are at liberty to Ally themſelves, and to do whatever they thought good.</p>
               <p>The Second, That we have great Intereſt to uſe all our endeavours to treat theſe Allies in ſuch a manner, as might not be eaſie for the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to have any of them for the future.</p>
               <p>The Third, That the King's earneſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59422:53"/>deſire for Peace, made him lay aſide all thoſe regards to <hi>Portugal</hi> which <hi>Spain</hi> affected to have for the Prince.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of my Diſcourſe was, That we ſhould once for all end this Aſtair, that whatever reſpected the Intereſts of Monſieur the Prince had been wholly concluded at <hi>Paris,</hi> and had it not been ſo, I had never taken ſuch a long Journey; That what remained behind, was to agree about the Gratification which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould give the Prince, to which the King would be obliged to conſent, provided it was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Majeſty, and contrary to what had been ſtipulated by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Treaty concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ended the Conference, in ſaying to me, That he would think again on the Quality and Form of this Gratification, which he ſtill call'd a Recompence, and that he hoped we might agree upon it the firſt time we ſhould ſee one another, which was referred to <hi>Saturday.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59422:53"/>
               <p>I ſhall not enter on a particular relation of what paſt on divers other Points, becauſe thoſe which we agreed on were not of great conſequence, and there was nothing concluded on others. Neither will I tell you, that he omits no occaſion to ſpeak of the King in the moſt obliging terms ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and expreſſes himſelf always on the Match, as if already concluded; and in the laſt place he told me, that the Infanta's Perſon would be well liked of in <hi>France,</hi> and that the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Mind was no whit inferiour to that of her Body.</p>
               <p>We reſolv'd a-freſh, that, to abridge the time, Mr. <hi>de Lionne</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Coloma</hi> ſhould ſet to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the neceſſary. Form to thoſe things of which we were agreed, and even go over again certain points on which they ſhould agree together, as being not of the greateſt conſequence.</p>
               <p>But being inform'd by a Letter which Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> wrote me this Morning, that not only he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59422:54"/>nothing with Don <hi>Pedro Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loma,</hi> but that he could do nothing with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom he had ſeen Yeſterday; I thereupon ſent him word, I could no longer bear with theſe delays, and that he would tell Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> I wiſh'd we had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in which I ſhould perceive by his Conduct what ſucceſs we might expect from this Affair.</p>
               <p>And having inſtructed Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> in the things I thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to inſinuate to Don <hi>Pedro Coloma,</hi> that by this Channel they might come to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> he has very well executed it, to the telling him I was afraid Monſieur the Prince would prove fatal to Chriſtendom, and be the cauſe of not making that Peace at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and agreed on at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe it's fit their Majeſties ſhould know my opinion in this matter, which is, That Don <hi>Lewis</hi> of his own humour, and by the hopes of obtaining ſomething to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59422:54"/>of Monſieur the Prince, will drive out the time as long as he can, according to the ſollicitation of <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and other Adherents of this Prince.</p>
               <p>In the Second place. I believe that <hi>Lainet,</hi> by his manner of acting, has gotten ſome aſcendant over the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſeeing he has not the power to determine himſelf on this Subject, and tho' he be never ſo well perſwaded by my Reaſons when he leaves the Conferences, yet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating them to <hi>Lainet,</hi> he furniſhes him with Supplies, and makes him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall be obliged to yield to them.</p>
               <p>Yet with all this, as I am oblig'd to try all means to put forward Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> and preſs him to a ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and that I know the preſent conſtitution of Affairs obliges the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeek its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the Peace: Yet I believe I may on good grounds ſay, that all this will end well; but it would be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to be poſitive in things ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Accidents.</p>

               <p>YEſterdays Conference was a little ſharp; I got from it with an entire ſatisfaction; in as much as the Stroaks which I gave, ſome of which being bold enough, have ſhewn me the bottom of Don
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59422:55"/>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> his Heart, and confirm'd me in the Judgment which I have made, That the end of this Negotiation will be good, and produce nothing but what ſhall be advantageous to the Service and Honour of the King.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Point which came into diſcourſe, was that of the Marriage; there was no great difficulty to agree in what was ſaid on this Point. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loma</hi> being ordered to draw up the Articles and Letters which the two Kings were to write to the Pope for a Diſpenſation, and all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which ſhould be neceſſary for the more ſpeedy finiſhing of this Affair.</p>
               <p>I made him a long Diſcourſe on the Renunciations, telling him, that as the King was going to be moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to promote and ſuſtain the Intereſt of the Sereniſſima Infanta, ſo I could not forbear propoſing her to be conſidered by the King her Father in this occaſion; and tho'
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59422:56"/>my Allegations could produce no effect, yet I fail'd not to ſtrengthen them with Reaſons apparent enough, the principal of which was, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſpoſition of the King to the Peace, yielding ſeveral Points on the belief he ſhould eſpouſe the Sereniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima Infanta, without her being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in <hi>Spain</hi> to make any Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; no one being able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the only conſideration of this Marriage could oblige the King to yield on eſſential Points in the Treaty of Peace, as he had done; ſeeing that without exceeding the bounds of Modeſty, I may ſay, that if the Infanta be the greateſt Match in <hi>Europe,</hi> the King is likewiſe the ſame. And as to the Emperour, his Dignity is tranſitory; and it's certain, he would eſteem himſelf the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prince in the World, could he ſtrip himſelf of his Quality and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to inveſt himſelf with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, That what I ſaid was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59422:56"/>true; but were I inform'd of the Offers which the Emperour had made to obtain the Infanta, and the great Advantages the King his Maſter might reap from this Alliance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as having preſerred that of the King, he has thereby given his Nephew the moſt ſenſible diſpleaſure imaginable, there being nothing able to appeaſe him: I ſhould be of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, That the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the making a cordial Friendſhip with the King of <hi>France</hi> before all other conſiderations whatever; and to add to the Affection of Uncle, the Tenderneſs of a Father: Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties know, and you likewiſe, that in this point he has told us the real Truth, and that when he ſpake of the Offers the Emperour made the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he means the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would have broke with <hi>France,</hi> and carried himſelf in all things as the Catholick King would have had him, had he granted him the Infanta as ſhe had been promis'd to him.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59422:57"/>
               <p>For the Renunciations, he told me, he well ſaw that I had ſpoken to him about them, that I might ſay, the King rendred this Office to the Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſima Infanta before he was her Spouſe; but that he did not doubt but I was well aſſured Don <hi>Lewis</hi> could not make in <hi>Spain</hi> the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of ſuch a thing, and that he would tell me as a ſecret, that in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Council there was not the leaſt thought of the Alliance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Renunciation, excepting what he and another had, all the Council being averſe to the Marriage it ſelf, believing that notwithſtanding theſe Renunciations, if his Maſter ſhould come to loſe his two Children, as was greatly to be apprehended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo young, the Eldeſt being not above Twenty Months, <hi>France</hi> would lay claim to the Succeſſion. I am well perſwaded of all this from very convincing Reaſons, and moreover, I very well remember what the Queen has ſeveral times told me,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59422:57"/>when the King her Brother had but one Son; but I have been more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear the ſame thing from the mouth of the chief Miniſter of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that all the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> have ſpoken conformably thereto.</p>
               <p>After this, he return'd to the charge on the Intereſts of Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur the Prince, repeating to me all the Reaſons he had mentioned to me in his favour in the preceding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, adding thereto what ever <hi>Lainet</hi> and the Adherents of the Prince had lately ſuggeſted to him; and he reproach'd me more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently than ever, in that his earneſt entreaties could not prevail with me to intercede with the King in favour of a Prince who deſired nothing more paſſionately, than to merit by his moſt humble Services and Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the good will of the King and Queen, and my Friendſhip in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, by giving me real marks of his; and that if he could but receive ſome reaſonable ſatisfaction, whereby
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59422:58"/>he might return into <hi>France</hi> without diſgrace, all things would paſs as Heart could wiſh, and in fine, we ſhould have another Golden Age.</p>
               <p>He enlarged himſelf much on all the Examples there were of the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe who had wandred from their Duty, as Monſieur the Prince had done; and he inſiſted chiefly on what the King had done in reference to Monſieur the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Mareſchals of <hi>Turenne, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincourt,</hi> and <hi>Foucaut;</hi> and that, in fine, it was common enough in <hi>France</hi> to commit the like Crimes, and not only to obtain Pardon for them, but alſo draw Advantages from 'em: And it was no hard matter for me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that he had ſtudied well the Leſſon which <hi>Lainet</hi> had given him on this ſubject, ſeeing he repeated it word for word.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, this laſt Clauſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe greatly moved me, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59422:58"/>as much as in them lies to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this Maxim, That Rebellion is not a Crime in <hi>France,</hi> but rather a means to raiſe ones Fortune. But I replied to him. That the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Mareſchal of <hi>Turenne</hi> had implor'd the King's Clemency, and were returned to their Duty with the greateſt Submiſſion, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending any thing, and without any other condition, than that of being re-eſtabliſh'd in the honour of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; that as to <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> and <hi>Foucaut,</hi> the King had done what the exigency of his Service requires, and that I well ſaw that <hi>Spain</hi> could have wiſh'd any thing elſe, to the end the firſt delivering them <hi>Peronne,</hi> Monſieur the Prince might have the liberty of ranging as far as the Gates of <hi>Paris;</hi> and that the other<note n="*" place="margin">Beſides the Mareſchal's Staff, he had Fifty Thouſand Louis Dor's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money.</note> holding firm in <hi>Brouage,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> it ſhould be impoſſible for us to end the Civil War, to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59422:59"/>recover all the places of the Kingdom which ſhe had made us to loſe, and to reduce <hi>Guienne</hi> and other Provinces as had been done: That as to the reſt, it was true, the <hi>French</hi> were more prone than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to fail in their Duty, but that the Kings, far from encouraging them by too much Mildneſs to hold always this ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, had always uſed them with the greateſt Rigour, when the welfare of their Service had not oblig'd them to do otherwiſe; that herein they varied not in <hi>France</hi> from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was uſed in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing when they could not remedy Rebellions and Inſurrections which happened, they had Patience, as is apparent in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Portuguiſe</hi> and <hi>Cataloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who have been always ſought to, and offer'd not only a Pardon, but moreover new Priviledges, and great Recompences to thoſe of the Country who had moſt Credit: In fine, I hereunto added the Example of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who having main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59422:59"/>their Rebellion to the end, had at length been acknowledged by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for Free and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent States, and their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours treated as thoſe of Soveraigns. And I concluded, That if more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and Revoltings were ſeen in <hi>France</hi> than in <hi>Spain,</hi> this miſhap was ſomewhat leſsned by the facility wherewith the <hi>French</hi> return'd to their Duty; which could not be ſaid of the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who having once thrown off the Yoke, never return'd to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience again, but by force, as appear'd ſufficiently by the Example of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who are peaceable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of ſeveral Provinces which were the Patrimony of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> not an Age paſt: That all the Revolts which had hapned in <hi>France</hi> had not yet caus'd the King to loſe a Thumb's breadth of Land; who on the contrary, by the apparent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, had extended on all hands the limits of his Kingdom,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59422:60"/>maugre the Union of ſo many Princes and Parliaments who had conſpir'd the Ruine of the State: So that the proneneſs of the <hi>French</hi> in failing in their Duty was corrected by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of their Return; whereas if the Subjects of <hi>Spain</hi> do more rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget themſelves; yet when they do it, they as ſeldom return.</p>
               <p>I well perceiv'd this Diſcourſe rack'd Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> and I told him, I was troubled he had oblig'd me to it, but the Honour of <hi>France</hi> and that of the King required it.</p>
               <p>In fine, ſhewing ſome emotion, he ſpake to me again in more earneſt terms of the ſatisfaction of Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur the Prince, telling me, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Honour was therein engaged, ſo that he could not excuſe himſelf from doing ſomething conſiderable for him, without expoſing himſelf to a perpetual blemiſh; and therefore he pray'd me once for all to tell him clearly what he might expect in this point; ſeeing this being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59422:60"/>all the reſt would be eaſily accorded in one ſingle Conference.</p>
               <p>It was here that I judg'd it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the good ſucceſs of this Negotiation, for the Service and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the King, and to know the bottom of Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Heart, to tranſport my ſelf by Addreſs, in raiſing a little my Voice. I told him then, Sir, you ſpeak with a great deal of liberty and freedom on the ſubject of Monſieur the Prince, which you regard as the principal deciſion of this whole Affair. For my part, I muſt declare to you, that having ſuffer'd more patiently than I ought Four Conferences to be taken up in conteſting a thing already adjuſted in the Treaty of Peace Signed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ratified without therein changing a word, That the King will do nothing beyond what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you; and that even when his Majeſty would permit me to make a longer ſtay on this Frontier, and we ſhould have an Hundred
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59422:61"/>more Conſerences, you will obtain nothing more of me, becauſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will never conſent, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould give the Prince a Recompence, which may ſerve as a Monument to Poſterity of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and of pernicious Example to Perſons of his Rank, to engage themſelves in the ſervice of <hi>Spain</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King and their Country, to gain like Recompences.</p>
               <p>He would have interrupted me here, but entreating him to let me to go on, I continued to ſay to him, That Monſieur the Prince muſt reſolve, as I have ſeveral times affirm'd, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholly a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> or wholly a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> That the King would never ſuffer he ſhould receive from his Catholick-Majeſty other gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that I already mentioned; That it not being reaſonable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom ſhould longer remain plung'd in the Abyſs of Miſeries, wherein a long War had thrown it for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts more or leſs of a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59422:61"/>to whom for the ſake of the Peace, the King had parted with a thouſand times more Favours than he ought, and the ſucceſs of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Kingdom permitted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Juſtice required the King ſhould uſe towards the Prince the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would uſe in relation to <hi>Portugal;</hi> otherwiſe I well ſaw, with a ſenſible diſpleaſure, that the conſideration of Monſieur the Prince, which had already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Three Years before the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peace at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to the prejudice of all Chriſtendom (of which they muſt give an account to God, who had been the cauſe) might moreover occaſion the rupture of a Peace Concluded, Signed, and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and that if the Emiſſaries of Monſieur the Prince and ſome other Perſons were able to perſwade Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> that holding out on this point, I would yield my ſelf in the end, it being impoſſible for me to reſolve to return without the work of the Peace
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59422:62"/>receiving its perfection, leſt I incur the hatred of the People: I therefore declared to him, that tho' it were true I ſhould be greatly grieved in not ſucceeding in an Affair ſo much deſired of all the World; yet I ſhould return with this conſolation, That no body could with the leaſt ſhew of Reaſon impute to me the fault of the rupture of the Peace, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of which I had ſo happily laboured at <hi>Paris;</hi> That I believed the King might expect from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs, in the continuation of the War, the ſame Advantages, and it may be greater than thoſe had been given him after the return of Monſieur de <hi>Lionne</hi> from <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein the only conſideration of Monſieur the Prince had hindred the concluſion of the Peace.</p>
               <p>It's not poſſible for you to tell me how ſmooth Don <hi>Lewis</hi> was after this bold Declaration, for there is no Civility nor obliging terms which he made not uſe of to ſatisfie me; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59422:62"/>poſitively, That nothing in the World ſhould be capable of ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us without the entire eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Peace, and the tye of a ſincere and perfect Amity between us; and that, in fine, he conjured me to give him this day to ſee what he has to do on what regards the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Monſieur the Prince; and that, if I thought fit, we might ſee one another again to Morrow, to terminate entirely this point, ſo that the King his Maſter might be content.</p>
               <p>Hence I took occaſion to be more certain that nothing was capable to make Don <hi>Lewis</hi> to break this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; ſeeing having ſpoken ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to him, and with ſuch liberty bidding him chooſe his Bargain, he had from that very Inſtant changed his Stile, ſpeaking to me in the terms I now related; to which my ſilence, and the indifferency I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for half an hour, engaged him more and more. And this is what has occaſioned me to begin this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59422:63"/>in the manner I have done, which is to ſay, by the judgment of what may be expected from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and Conduct of Don <hi>Lewis</hi> in this Negotiation.</p>
               <p>After we had pauſed a while, and I had began on my ſide to uſe more ſoftneſs, I thought it fitting to make a tryal by a wile, and which ſhould, without engaging me to any thing, diſcover whether at bottom Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſo great a Paſſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in effect the ſatisfaction of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, or whether it was only from oſtentation, and to make a matter of Merit with the Prince, that he inſiſted with ſo great firmneſs that Eſtabliſhments ſhould be given him, offering ſtill more conſiderable ones, as he found more repugnance in us to conſent, ſeeing as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready denoted to you, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as the giving him either the two <hi>Calabrias</hi> or <hi>Sardaignia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I judg'd I ought no longer to defer the knowing the bottom of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59422:63"/>his thoughts in this point, to the end I might ſee whether we might make our profit of the permiſſion which the King hd given me on the ſubject of Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>I took then occaſion to exagerate the ſmall reaſon he had to adviſe the King his Maſter to offer Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur the Prince not only conſiderable Sums of Money, as a mark of the good will he had for him, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Government of the Low Countries, with the ſame Authority and the ſame Emoluments as the Cardinal Infant had, beſides the Gift of ſeveral conſiderable Places of that Country ſcituated on the Frontiers of <hi>France;</hi> ſeeing Monſieur the Prince himſelf (who is Intereſſed in the thing, and who ſhould himſelf forge Reaſons to make it be believ'd he ſhould receive theſe Advantages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this depriving him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which the King had already offered to grant him) had declared, he would not accept of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59422:64"/>the Oath of Fidelity which he ſhould be obliged to make to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being inconſiſtent with his re-eſtabliſhment in the King's Favour; which was ſo true, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had confirm'd to me what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Caillet</hi> had told me conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hereunto.</p>
               <p>And as to Places, tho' Monſieur the Prince ſhould not refuſe the offer which Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had made him from the part of the King his Maſter, but on the contrary, declare he would accept this offer; yet it is not to be doubted but he was perſwaded the King would in no wiſe conſent to it; the ſame <hi>Caillet</hi> having told me, when going into <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the intention of the Prince was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to remit them to the King, to the end his Majeſty might know he would hold no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to endeavour by my meditation to obtain ſome recompence in <hi>France,</hi> which might render him unſuſpected.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59422:64"/>
               <p>And I had the more reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was the intention of Monſieur the Prince to deal thus, in that <hi>Caillet</hi> returning from <hi>Flanders,</hi> intreated me earneſtly at <hi>Bayonne</hi> not to withſtand the Advantages which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would offer his Maſter, in giving him conſiderable Poſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſeeing he could aſſure me afreſh, that Monſieur the Prince would uſe them, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſhould be preſcribed by his Majeſty, who would thus draw all the Advantage of the Places which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould preſent him with. And continuing my diſcourſe, I told Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> I believ'd that not only Monſieur the Prince had given order to <hi>Caillet</hi> to ſpeak to me thus, but that likewiſe his Excellency muſt approve of it, ſeeing he teſtified to deſire only the ſatisfaction of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince in whatever manner he deſired.</p>
               <p>I concluded, I had no other end in repreſenting to him all this, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59422:65"/>to make him ſee that Monſieur the Prince himſelf had judg'd he could not accept the Government of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> nor receive Places, but only to put them into the King's hands, and to receive of his Majeſty ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
               <p>Had it been true that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had no other intention but that of ſatisfying Monſieur the Prince, he would not have fail'd of entring on the matter, and preſſing me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for him ſome eſtabliſhment in <hi>France,</hi> in recompence of the Places which the King his Maſter would give him: But I ſaw plainly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for having been long perplext to anſwer me, he told me the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Maſter was not to give Places to Monſieur the Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking ſureties that they ſhould not go out of his hands; that his Catholick Majeſty pretended to give him them only for a time, till he was entirely reſtored in <hi>France,</hi> and ſeveral other ordinary Reaſons which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59422:65"/>concluded nothing, but which yet clearly confirm'd me in what I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, as I have ſeveral times ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you.</p>
               <p>After this were read all the points remitted here to be adjuſted in the Conferences we were to have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſeem'd to be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to end them ſpeedily, whereto I hope will not a little contribute the manner I ſpake to him. In effect, he gave orders to the Secretary in my preſence, to ſet immediately with Mr. <hi>de Lionne</hi> to the drawing up moſt of theſe points in ſuch terms as they two ſhould judge moſt agreeable. Here is what I thought fit you ſhould inform their Majeſties touching what has particularly paſs'd in this laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

               <p>I Came juſt now from the Fifth Conference, but being unwilling to defer any longer to ſend you the relation of what has paſt in the laſt, which ſeems important enough to be known by their Majeſties: I therefore ſend back again to you the ſame Currier you ſent me, and who delivered me your Letters as I was going into the Coach, to go to the uſual Rendezvous, which I cannot anſwer till to Morrow, when I ſhall likewiſe inform you of what paſt to day.</p>
               <p>Yet I will tell you in ſhort, to ſatisfie in ſome ſort the curioſity their Majeſties may have, that Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59422:66"/>every day more eaſie, Don <hi>Lewis</hi> having ſpoken very ſoberly to me touching Monſieur the Prince, and in ſuch rerms as farther confirm me in the opinion that this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be happily ended. I intreat you to repreſent to their Majeſties, that I cannot have a greater pleaſure than in writing to them every hour what paſſes; but this is impoſſible, for, without Hyperbolizing, I have ſcarce time to breath, all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Princes which are here ſtriving to viſit me at every moment; the Conferences conſuming a whole Day, conſidering the time which is ſpent in going and returning to the Iſle, which is two Leagues hence, and the way thither very tireſome.</p>
               <p>And moreover, I am not only oblig'd to write to you as I do, that their Majeſties may be inform'd of what paſſes, but moreover in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all the King's Miniſters more exactly than I did when I had the honour to be near his Majeſty.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59422:67"/>
               <p>I write to you in ſuch haſte, that I have not ſo much time as to read over what I have dictated, ſo that if there be any fault, and every thing be not in ſo good order as I would have it, I intreat you to give your ſelf the trouble to excuſe me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to their Majeſties.</p>

               <p>I Thought that Yeſterday's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which was the Fifth,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59422:68"/>would have begun by the point of Monſieur the Prince, becauſe Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had entertain'd Monſieur de <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne</hi> a long time, on his telling him, by my order, that I was not well ſatisfied, in underſtanding the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not to make ſatisfaction to Monſieur the Prince, as Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſo many times proteſted, but only to render him conſiderable by Places, which might enable him in certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures to diſturb the State; and likewiſe to incourage, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Recompence, the Perſons of his condition, and others, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage readily on the ſide of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he began by asking me News of the King and Queen's Health, and by telling me, that the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had laid his Commands upon him to intreat me to bring him to the Feet of their Majeſties, (theſe are his own terms) and to aſſure them he wiſht for nothing more paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than to ſee himſelf there in effect,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59422:68"/>and that he expected this Happineſs with great reaſon, ſeeing by the Letters he had received from <hi>Madrid,</hi> he knew that the King his Maſter reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on ſetting out ſooner than the Firſt of <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He afterwards added, that being entred into my Apartment, he had admired the King's Picture done by <hi>Mignard,</hi> had obſerv'd in it a Prince well ſhaped, of good Meen, and great Majeſty; that he would write this afreſh into <hi>Spain;</hi> and could tell me without Flattery, That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reniſſima Infanta <hi>(Tenia muy linda cara, y muy buen entendimiento)</hi> had a good Countenance, and as good Senſe; and that, in fine, ſhe was worthy to be the Spouſe of ſuch a King. I will make a digreſſion, and tell you how I find confirm'd what Don <hi>Lewis</hi> told me in reference to the Catholick King, which is, That Don <hi>Pedro Coloma</hi> has ſhewed Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> a Letter from his Wife, in which ſhe ſignifies to him, the King
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59422:69"/>would not let the Infanta come alone, without accompanying her himſelf, as the King his Father did in reſpect of the Queen, ſeeing he loved no leſs his Daughter, than <hi>Philip</hi> III. loved his; and that it was reſolved on, it ſhould be Don <hi>Lewis</hi> who ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of conducting her, that another might not have this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. In effect, the Duke de <hi>Lerma,</hi> chief Miniſter of <hi>Philip</hi> III. ſhould have conducted the Queen, had he not been ſurprized by Sickneſs, which oblig'd him to remit this Honour to the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zeda</hi> his Son: She ſays farther in the ſame Letter, that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infanta a viſit, to tell her that the affair which reſpected her was much advanced, and that her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant drew near the Frontier: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>muy cara y alegra nueva, mi padre me lo ha dicho todo,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>This news rejoyces me, my Father told me as much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return'd to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who largely diſcours'd to me of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59422:69"/>how the interview might be made on the Frontier; but this being a thing of which I muſt more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly entertain their Majeſties, I ſhall not mention any thing farther on this point.</p>
               <p>He entred in diſcourſe on what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the reſtitution of <hi>Juliers</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> on which point Monſieur de <hi>Lionne</hi> had largely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd the day before with Don <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro Coloma,</hi> in examining with him the points which remain to be adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He told me, 'twas ſurprizing he ſhould have ſuch a pretenſion, and that it was ſo equitable, that he would not ſtick to counſel his Maſter to do what I adviſed him hereupon; for he did not doubt but I would make ſome reflection on the manner the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> had uſed, after having been ſo long time under the protection of the Catholick King, making a Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and engaging himſelf to embrace its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts as he had done, with ſo little
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59422:70"/>reſpect to his Catholick Majeſty, and ſo great prejudice to his Affairs, that he would make me judge whether his proceeding deſerved a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and he to be put into a better condition than he was in when he was allyed with <hi>France;</hi> that he well ſaw all I could fairly pretend to was (to the end it might not appear the King my Maſter abandoned his Allies) that the Catholick King ſhould forget what was paſt, and promiſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid Duke and his Intereſts, as he did before he took the King's part.</p>
               <p>I replied to him, We were far from our reckoning, ſeeing I was perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was nothing ſo juſt as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Juiliers</hi> to the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> to whom this place belong'd in juſt and full right, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having none to it, having been only put into his hands as a Pledge by the Father of this Duke, to be kept againſt powerful Enemies who would have deprived him of it. That Don
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59422:70"/>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> knew all this Dutchy went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under his Name, and that the Duke apprehending no more to loſe it, ſeeing the Peace which was going to be concluded, impowered him to keep it without any fear; ſo I therefore could not tell how he could do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than reſtore it to him. That the King had given a good Example in the like occaſion, ſeeing he not only reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Four Places he had put in truſt into his Hands, which were the only ones which remained to him in <hi>Piemont,</hi> (he having loſt all the others, and knowing well it was impoſſible to keep them) but alſo, all the reſt to the number of Sixteen, which his Majeſty had all won by his Arms, and return'd to the ſaid Duke as faſt as he re-eſtabliſh'd himſelf, and was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to keep theſe ſaid Places; and that ſo generous an Example ſhould perſwade his Catholick Majeſty to an imitation, in reſtoring to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> a ſingle place which had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59422:71"/>been delivered to him in truſt, ſeeing the King had reſtored Twenty Two, the greateſt part of which had coſt him ſo much Blood and Treaſure: That the King having made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of promiſing to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> in the Treaty his Majeſty had made with him, to procure him the ſurrender of <hi>Juliers,</hi> ſeeing it was his Patrimony; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having ſo oft declared, by his Miniſters in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to his Father and to him, that he would reſtore him this place as ſoon as the Peace ſhould be made: I therefore could not ſee how his Majeſty can excuſe himſelf from keeping his Word in ſo equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a thing, ſeeing I had ſeen his Excellency ſo firm in demanding the ſatisfaction of Monſieur the Prince, alledging for his greateſt Reaſon, that the Catholick King had promiſed by a Treaty to procure it him, and ſo much the rather, in that there was a great difference between a Soveraign Prince, who required the reſtitution
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59422:71"/>of a Place which he had parted with in truſt, and a Subject, who would have a Recompence for having in a moſt rebellious manner taken up Arms againſt his Prince, and procured, at his Country's coſt, conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to its Enemies: That the Oſter he had made me was no great matter: That the King his Maſter ſhould conſider the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> as before, without any grudge or Heart-burning; in as much as the Allies being to be comprehended in the Treaty, the Catholick King could not exempt himſelf from uſing the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> as the other Allies of <hi>France,</hi> this Duke being no leſs a Soveraign than the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> So that if the King has the goodneſs to pardon Monſieur the Prince, who, being his Subject, had forgot his Duty in ſuch a manner as he had done, it will be no great matter for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King to do the ſame with the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> who was a Free Prince.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59422:72"/>
               <p>Methinks there can be no anſwer to this; yet he long conteſted, tho' with very weak Arguments, being not able to find good ones in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of this nature. I held out ſtill firm; and ſeeing he was ſo too on his ſide, and that the Secretary of State had told Monſieur de <hi>Lionne,</hi> that he did not doubt but this point was likely to hinder the Peace, if I yielded not; I therefore told Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> that I had not the power to do it, but would diſpatch a Currier to the King to know his pleafure.</p>
               <p>I believ'd I ought to ſuſtain this point with the firmneſs I have done, not only that it may ſerve to ſhew the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſerve him to the end, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even reſolved to tell Don <hi>Lewis</hi> in the firſt Conference, That the King has commanded me to offer the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Bergue</hi> without any Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, provided juſtice be done this Duke; but likewiſe that this releaſe which I'le make valuable, may ſerve
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59422:72"/>to obtain ſome advantage in other points.</p>
               <p>And it's fit the King ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on this ſubject, that having well foreſeen the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to give this ſatisfaction to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> and much leſs at the mediation of <hi>France;</hi> I am therefore of opinion his Majeſty ſhould engage himſelf no farther in the Treaty making at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Miniſters of this Duke, than to do all good Offices in his favour.</p>
               <p>He ſpake to me afterwards of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> ſaying, The King his Maſter judg'd it not fitting to ſend the Ratification of the Treaty which the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldaigne</hi> had made with this Prince, becauſe he had diſcover'd two things; one of which was inconſiſtent with what an Article of the Treaty of <hi>Paris</hi> bore touching the payment of the Dowry of the Infanta <hi>Margarita,</hi> this Count having promiſed to the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> what we would have given to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59422:73"/>the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which was to leave him the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of <hi>Correggio</hi> without the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s keeping a Garriſon there) could not be ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing <hi>Fuenſaldaigne</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it without having the power to do it. Adding, it was not reaſonable this Prince ſhould be in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for joyning himſelf to <hi>France</hi> againſt the Catholick King, than when he adhered more to <hi>Spain</hi> than <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told him I could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how they could retard one day the ſending the Ratification of a Treaty ſolemnly made by a Miniſter Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> and his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend; and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was immediately exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſincerely by the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> who had ſent back the Troops of <hi>France,</hi> which he had kept for the ſecurity of his Country; had written to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the term, the Count had deſired; and,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59422:73"/>in fine, had done in general whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was engaged to by the ſame Treaty: That I knew not what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the World would make of the delaying the Ratification, and that at leaſt for the time to come there would be reaſon (perhaps to the great prejudice of <hi>Spain</hi>) not to truſt the higheſt Miniſters of that Court. That the Duke had put ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in what the Count <hi>de Fuenſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigne</hi> had promiſed him on the point of <hi>Correggio</hi> (on which this Count had received the Emperor's anſwer, that he might do it, and that he would give the inveſtiture, when the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be ſigned, and the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſhould ſend to deſire it) that his Highneſs had already named an Embaſſador to do this Office, and I even believ'd he was gone in all haſte to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He made me replies, ſuch as one may well judge, the matter being ſo juſt and clear; but I ſtopt his mouth, as you ſhall ſee, in telling him there
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59422:74"/>was no need of ratifying this Treaty, which was already in better form, than if the Ratification had been ſent directly to <hi>Milan,</hi> ſeeing there was an Article in the Treaty ſigned at <hi>Paris,</hi> by which it was ſaid, that in reſpect of the intereſts of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> what he had treated and concluded with the Count <hi>de Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaldaigne,</hi> ſhould be confirmed; ſo that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having ſent the Ratification of the Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> this Article by conſequence was no leſs ratified than the reſt.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſeeing he had nothing to anſwer me, ſaved himſelf by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, That in conſideration the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> was my Nephew, the King his Maſter would paſs over this point as I deſired.</p>
               <p>I told him I was far from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as an obligation, what his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty could not excuſe himſelf from doing, without viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Juſtice and Honour; that the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> would have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59422:74"/>great reaſon to complain of me, ſhould I pretend he were indebted to me for a thing, which is due to him by a Treaty, by which he had likewiſe conſented and executed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points in the manner as the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldaigne</hi> had deſired. The Concluſion was, an Article ſhould be inſerted in the Treaty, which ſhould be couch'd in the terms I deſired.</p>
               <p>I took afterwards a Paper, in which are markt in Abridgment, all the points which remain to be adjuſted, to the number of twenty, and we agreed in all, excepting five or ſix, the firſt of which is a pretenſion which I dexterouſly propoſed to joyn <hi>Conſtans</hi> to the County of <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> which is a contiguous Country, and of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable extent, ſeeing it conſiſts of more than two hundred and fifty Villages.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concerns the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>Bergue</hi> and <hi>la Baſſee,</hi> the firſt of which I may ſay, without
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59422:75"/>bragging, I have gained to the King by pure addreſs.</p>
               <p>The third regards the pretenſions which I likewiſe advanced, to have not only the <hi>Bailywick</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> but moreover the places of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which depends on no <hi>Baily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> as <hi>Merville</hi> and the Provoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Chavancy,</hi> to which in truth we have no right.</p>
               <p>The fourth is touching what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be adjuſted for a Road, which we pretend in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Salt Pits of that Country, for which Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has entreated me to tarry till an Officer of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> arrives, who will ſoon be here, and have power to treat and conclude whatever may regard the intereſts of this Prince.</p>
               <p>The fifth concerns the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> and for very ſtrong reaſons I placed it then laſt, as having judg'd 'twas not for the King's ſervice to inſiſt thereon, before we agreed to the preamble of all the other points.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59422:75"/>
               <p>Yet we ſpoke of it ſeveral times, agreeing that this was too wicked an Example, to be left unpuniſhed to Poſterity, that Subjects ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign their King, and put him to death; and that the Republick of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhing it ſelf, 'twas a power to be redoubted by all it's Neighbours, ſeeing, without exage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it would be an hundred times more formidable than that of their Kings.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you, that the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Heſdin</hi> is agreed to be made on the day appointed, he taking on him the execution in ſome ſort or other of what he has promis'd hereupon.</p>
               <p>I do not ſet down for the ſixth the affair of Monſieur the Prince, tho' this has been the ſubject of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of our Conferences, becauſe that though Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a word thereupon, yet it ſeems to me he is reſolved, and will herein pretend nothing which may retard or break the Peace.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59422:76"/>
               <p>I was in ſome kind of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that three hours had paſt, without his ſo much as mentioning Monſieur the Prince; when he began to ſay to me: <hi>Will you be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute? We ſhall ſeparate without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome ſatisfaction to Monſieur the Prince, as I have ſo many times told you the King my Maſter is oblig'd in Honour to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told him, I thought this affair was ended, and no more talk ſhould be of it, and ſo much the rather, in that I thought that the ſatisfaction of this Prince did not ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, as to put him into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more conſiderable than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nor to give him ſignal marks, by which might be always ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> how the Catholick Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the <hi>French,</hi> who range themſelves on their ſide; ſeeing on what I had ſaid to him of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which <hi>Caillet</hi> had made me, he had ſufficiently declared himſelf, that in giving Places to this Prince,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59422:76"/>they would take the neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, that they might not fall into the hands of the King; which had the more ſurpriſed me, that I had imagined, his Excellency would be greatly pleaſed, if by means of the gratification which his Catholick Majeſty would give to Monſieur the Prince, he might attain to that of changing it into other things, which were more likely to contribute to his re-eſtabliſhment in the King's favour, his Soveraign, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to <hi>Spain</hi> remaining behind; there being nothing in my opinion, and that of all his Relations and Friends, more neceſſary than this for his quiet, and the welfare of his affairs.</p>
               <p>I added, that I had ever obſerv'd the greateſt pleaſure he could have, who imparted a benefit, was, when this benefit might produce to him who receives it, ſomething more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and more honourable; but that ſeeing his Excellency was far from having this aim in reſpect of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59422:77"/>Monſieur the Prince, I was forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will to believe he could have no other end, than that which I denoted heretofore; inſiſting boldly on the giving great advantages to Monſieur the Prince, in aſſurance the King would not grant them, and thus he might oblige Monſieur the Prince at ſmall coſt.</p>
               <p>I muſt acknowledge to you, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve never man was ſo put to it as Don <hi>Lewis</hi> appear'd to me in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for aſſuredly it is fallen into his head, that if <hi>Lainet</hi> and the other Adherents of Monſieur the Prince ſhould come to know the diſcourſe I held to him, he will be troubled to get off from granting him what he has ſo many times offered, and which might wholly meliorate his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſtudied a long time, and though he told me afterwards reaſons which would not permit him to give Places to Monſieur the Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a caution they ſhould not go out of his Hands, he added he would
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59422:77"/>conſider afreſh what might be done for this Prince; to ſee if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whether he could be ſo happy, to find out ſome means whereby to give a ſatisfaction which I could approve.</p>
               <p>But I replied to him with the ſame firmneſs, that there is no other than the giving him ſome Sum of Mony to make ſome conſiderable purchaſe of Land; and that for the diſcourſes which I had held him, which perhaps he might take for an overture capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of meliorating the condition of Monſieur the Prince, I conjured him to believe, that the only deſire of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in a thing, which he had made known to me in ſuch earneſt terms, had induced me to this. For to be plain, I much doubted whether the King would conſent to this, tho' I was determin'd to go and caſt my ſelf at his Feet to ſupplicate him; and that however, I proteſted to him he could not do me a greater pleaſure than not to take me at my word, and to end this affair as is mention'd in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59422:78"/>Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> in converting into Silver the Prince's Gratification, as I have already above denoted.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you, that I had made him before this Propoſition, That if he would give to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Sardaignia,</hi> which he had offered to Monſieur the Prince, I would ſignifie as much to his Majeſty, and uſe my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make him reliſh this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, with which the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> might be ſatisfied; and I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly enlarged my ſelf hereupon, to put him from inſiſting any more in hopes of ſucceeding in the behalf of Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>I told him; Sir, here's the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the World to ſatisfie this King, and to give an opportunity to the King my Maſter, to ſhew to the World that he obtains for his Ally a handſom Retreat, as likewiſe to end the War on all hands; ſeeing the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> embracing this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the Catholick King, without
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59422:78"/>drawing his Sword, may put himſelf in poſſeſſion of ſeveral Kingdoms, the leaſt of which is more conſiderable than that of <hi>Sardaignia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Propoſition ſerved only the more to perplex him, without his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to offer any ſolid reaſon to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed can there be any; for it would be far more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his Catholick Majeſty, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Portugal,</hi> without ſtriking a ſtroke, in yielding <hi>Sardaignia</hi> to this King, than to give as a pure gift this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as the principal end of the Relation I here make you, is to inform the King, and, if I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my ſelf ſo, to inſtruct his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in whatever there is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for his Service, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the intereſts of his Crown; ſo I will not omit, as far as my little leiſure will give me leave, to make known to the King all the accidents which happen in ſeveral occaſions in our Conferences.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59422:79"/>
               <p>And therefore I will tell you, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> having taken again this laſt time occaſion to exagerate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary advantages received from this Peace, by the means of which his Majeſty aſſured his Conqueſts, and extended their limits on all ſides: I told him, that the King would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly renounce all this, if his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty would only deliver him <hi>Navarre</hi> in exchange, which all the World knows belongs to him by ſo good a Title, that there's not a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who, from the firſt uſe of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is not perſwaded the King has no leſs right to this Kingdom than to the City of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ask'd me, if I knew what <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> was, ſeeing 'twas no greater than <hi>Rouſillon? Accept then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal I made you</hi> (ſaid I to him) <hi>aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, that if you take me at my word, the King will make it good; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will do nothing herein, but had rather keep this little Country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not above Two or Three
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59422:79"/>Places; for you well know; that the King my Maſter had once</hi> Pampelune, <hi>his Catholick Majeſty would be forced to diſlodge from</hi> Madrid.</p>
               <p>He told me in another Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the effects of War are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; that the Affairs of the Allies of <hi>France</hi> proceeded not ſo well in <hi>Germany</hi> as we could wiſh; that they were near ſeeing in <hi>England</hi> ſuch changes, as would give <hi>Spain</hi> as many advantages as <hi>France</hi> had during the time of <hi>Cromwell;</hi> that there was nothing to be expected from the Commotions in <hi>Naples;</hi> and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Peace was not made, there might a great many things happen in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which would give the King his Maſter an opportunity to draw this Thorn out of his Foot, and to employ elſewhere the Forces he had hitherto been conſtrain'd to uſe on that ſide.</p>
               <p>I anſwer'd him in two Words. <hi>Do you know why? It is becauſe all is aſleep; and that you do not ſee ſeveral things
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59422:80"/>break forth on all ſides, which will give you juſt reaſon to apprehend the progreſs of</hi> France <hi>for the future, more than you have done hitherto; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King, expecting whether the Peace will be made, has ordered me to ſuperſede all Negotiations, which may make him enter into new engagements with</hi> Swedeland, England, <hi>and</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>although we be continually ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited from all ſides, with ſuch offers as would affect any other Prince, who can be leſs ſenſible than him of the Miſeries which ſo long a War has brought on Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I concluded, That perhaps we had ſhut our Ears to more plauſible Propoſitions, and which might better ſucceed in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> than all thoſe which had been made to us heretofore; and that I prayed to God with all my Heart, that the execution of the Peace might oblige me to lye ſtill, otherwiſe I could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew <hi>France</hi> to be in a more likely condition than ever to make her ſelf ſeared.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59422:80"/>
               <p>We paſs'd afterwards to entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves very friendly on the conveniencies which the two Crowns would find from the Peace; and I told him, that I could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how thoſe who had heretofore held our Places, and our ſelves too, had not always laboured with all our powers to unite our Maſters; ſeeing this Union rais'd equally the power of both, without giving them the leaſt jealouſie; that I could aſſure him, the greateſt part of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> would not have a Peace; and that thoſe whoſe Intereſt it was to ſee it concluded, ſeared nothing more than to behold a ſtrict friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip made between the two Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both one and the other ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their advantage in the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War, or at leaſt, in the fomentation of Jealouſies and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts between the two Crowns; that the Conduct and Intentions of theſe Princes ſeemed to me to learn us what we ſhould do; and that it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59422:81"/>was ſtrange, we being able to give Laws to all of 'em, we ſhould put our ſelves into a condition to receive it from them; and that in ſtead of obliging them to make their court to our Maſters, by jealouſies one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they ſhould court 'em them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the great prejudice of their dignity. But after all, ſaid I to him again, what reaſon can the two Kings have to make War ſo obſtinately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and with ſo great damage to their States and Subjects, ſeeing it is certain, that neither the Revolutions which can happen thence, nor the progreſs which the Arms of the one can make over the other in diverſe times, will ever be capable of ruining ſo well one, that the two Powers become entirely one ſingle Body.</p>
               <p>He teſtified he liked very well my diſcourſe, and having repeated it, he told me there was no replying to what I ſaid; but I will tell you in your Ear, to the end only their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59422:81"/>may know it, that it troubles me to ſee him ſo indifferent for the executing of any great Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Let me entreat you to take care, that this particular be only known of their Majeſties, it being of the greateſt importance, that no one elſe hears it.</p>
               <p>It is fit to write to the Chancellour, to impart to him in general that the Buſineſs advances, and that there's reaſon to hope all will end well, to the ſatisfaction of all honeſt People.</p>
               <p>You do me a pleaſure in drawing up the Titles I muſt take on me in the Treaty: I could be well enough ſatisfied with that of Cardinal, but Don <hi>Lewis</hi> inſerting his, I muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think my ſelf in Honour bound to do the like. Beſides I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed Poſterity ſhould ſee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I have received from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties: I think I have that of firſt Counſellour to the King, and that I may likewiſe aſſume that of Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> altho' my Letters are not Regiſtred in Parliament.</p>

               <p>I Have receiv'd your Letter with the draught of that which you have wrote for the Pope, on which I ſhall diſcourſe to you by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only tell you by the way, that the clauſe which you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in two Brackets, and which you tell me has been likewiſe ſo by Don <hi>Pedro Coloma</hi> in his rough draught for the King his Maſter, is not conſiſtent with what is agreed on by the Preamble of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>And therefore I have thought of an Expedient which I will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to you to night, if you return
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59422:82"/>here, as I judge 'twill be neceſſary: I profeſs I am aſtoniſht at what Don <hi>Lewis</hi> told you, touching the Dowry of the Infanta; for methinks he ſhould not ſo much as uſe a word in an affair which ſpeaks of it ſelf, and ſo concluſive for us, that I dare engage when I ſee him it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to mention a little about it.</p>
               <p>I have written to <hi>Colbert</hi> touching the Dutchy of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and as to what concerns the Stewardſhip of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> you may reckon to draw from thence about 20000 Crowns a year, as the King has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, till ſuch time his Majeſty hath given you for your Children one or two Abbies, of whoſe Revenue I have heretofore acquainted you.</p>
               <p>I could have wiſht I had been given only the Title of Cardinal in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſeeing I muſt do as Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has done; and that it is fit the World ſhould ſee the favours I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King and Queen, I

               <p>As to the point of Monſieur the Prince, he ſpake to me again largely about it, but in other terms than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, beginning to declare to me he would conteſt no more thereupon, and that this ſhould not hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the Peace, ſeeing he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to comply with whatever his Majeſty ſhould deſire on this point.</p>
               <p>And as to the Marriage, we are almoſt agreed in all the Articles rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it; in which Monſieur <hi>de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne</hi> and the Secretary of State <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> do continually buſie themſelves, as well as in the Letters, and other Writings neceſſary for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Affair, to the end Don <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> on his part, and I on mine, may ſend to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> the Memoirs to draw up the neceſſary diſpatches. He declared to me he was mightily concern'd at the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the time, if this affair were to be diſpatcht in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> ſeeing the Infanta could not be eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> before the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59422:86"/>from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that whatever diligence ſhould be uſed for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being neceſſary to diſpatch the Currier from <hi>Madrid</hi> for this effect, with the King his Maſter's Letter, he believ'd this could not be done till towards the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> at ſooneſt. Adding other motives to convince me of the length of time which this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair would take up, when even the King his Maſter ſhould uſe all poſſible diligence on his part: I plainly ſaw he would make me underſtand he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it impoſſible this could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd within the time I had always mentioned; ſeeing that tho' the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta ſhould not defer her departure above Two Days after her Eſpouſals, yet ſhe muſt be on the Road near Twenty Three or Twenty Four Days.</p>
               <p>Which ſaid, he gave me an hint on his Maſters indiſpoſition, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Age, would not let him take this Journey at the beginning of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I anſwer'd what I thought fit, and he remitted the reſt to the firſt

               <p>I can aſſure you, that theſe Letters and yours have wrought a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the mind of Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> and given me occaſion to quicken him to end this Negotiation, whereby to put an end to all occaſions of Jealouſie and Suſpicion, which every day encreaſed.</p>

               <p>LEt me entreat you to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded once for all, that I cannot render you a greater and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervice, than to ſpeak to you with the liberty you have permitted me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, in matters relating to your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, for which none of your Majeſties Servants can be more earneſt and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with ſpeaking to that part of your Letter of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which relates to the deference the perſon in queſtion has for me; and the other points you have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me in her favour. I am not ſurpriſed at what you write, ſeeing the paſſion you have for her, as is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with others, hinders you from diſcerning the truth; and I muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, that were it not for this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you would agree with me; that this Perſon is not capable of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59422:90"/>that ſhe has an ambition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds, a reſtleſs and awkard Spirit, a contempt for all the World, no prudence in her conduct, and an inclination to all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, that<note n="*" place="margin">The Sequel has ſhew'd he knew his Niece's humour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</note> ſhe is more fooliſh than ever, ſince ſhe has had the Honour to ſee you at St. <hi>John d' Angely;</hi> and that inſtead of receiving your Letters twice a Week, ſhe receives them now every day. In fine, you would ſee as well as I, that ſhe has a thouſand defects, and not one quality which may render her worthy your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You teſtifie in your Letter to believe, that the opinion I have of her proceeds from the ill Offices done her. Is it poſſible you can believe I am ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrant and able in great affairs, and that I cannot ſee a jot into thoſe of my Family? Can I doubt of the intentions of this Perſon in my reſpect, when I ſee ſhe never forgets to do the contrary in every thing I deſire; that ſhe turns into
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59422:90"/>ridicule the advices I give for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; that ſhe glories in that, which in the ſight of all the World preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices her Honour, and mine; that ſhe will needs become the Maſter, and change all the orders I give in my Houſe; and that, in fine, deſpiſing all the diligences I have uſed with ſo great love, application and addreſs, to bring her into a good courſe, and make her wiſe; ſhe perſiſts in her follies, and will be thus expoſed to the laughter of all the World, who make it a continual Subject of Comedies, as will appear from the Papers I keep by me, in which you may ſee the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of all thoſe who diſcourſe on this matter, which is at preſent the Enterainment of the beſt Wits of all Nations.</p>
               <p>Did the ill conduct of this Perſon prejudice only her ſelf, and even me, I might diſſemble it; but this evil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day increaſing, and this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce doing an irreparable injury to the Glory and Quiet of my Maſter,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59422:91"/>it is impoſſible for me to ſuffer it; and I ſhall be at length conſtrained to take reſolutions, by which every one may be fully convinced, that when the matter concerns your ſervice, I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all. And if I find my ſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to perceive the paſſion you have for this Creature blinds your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I muſt take up the deſign I ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to you from <hi>Cadillac;</hi> for, in ſhort, there is no power which can deprive me of diſpoſing how I pleaſe of my Family; and you will be one day the firſt in commending me for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I have done you, which will be certainly the greateſt of all, ſeeing by my reſolution I have put you into a condition of being happy, and with this the moſt Glorious and Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt King on earth, Beſides, mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the Example of Humility, ſaid that he would not give to another <hi>(Honorem meum nemini dabo)</hi> obliges me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no longer the doing what I ought to preſerve it.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59422:91"/>
               <p>I return to the Perſon who holds her ſelf more certain than ever to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe entirely of your Affection, after the new promiſes you have made her at St. <hi>John d'Angely:</hi> and I know that if you be oblig'd to marry, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make the Princeſs that ſhall eſpouſe you miſerable all her life; which cannot happen without your being ſo too, and expoſing your ſelf to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vexatious diſaſters. For you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect the bleſſing of Heaven, if you do nothing for your part to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. Since the laſt viſit, which I ever believ'd would be fatal to you, and for which reaſon I endeavoured to hinder it, you have begun again to write to her every day, not Letters, but entire Volumes, imparting to her the moſt minute circumſtances of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and placing in her the greateſt confidence, to the excluſion of every body elſe. So that all your time is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in reading hers, and writing yours. And that which is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, is, that you practiſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59422:92"/>all imaginable expedients to heat your Paſſion, whilſt you are at the Eve of your Marriage. Thus do you your ſelf labour to make your ſelf the moſt miſerable of all Men; there being no condition more intollerable, than a Marriage made againſt ones Stomach.</p>
               <p>But pray tell me, I beſeech you, what perſonage does this Girl pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to act after you be married? Has ſhe ſo far forgot her Duty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that when I ſhould be ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or, to ſpeak better, ſufficiently infamous, to allow it, that ſhe can drive on a trade ſo long which will ruine her Reputation? Perhaps ſhe thinks ſhe can do this without any bodies murmuring at it, after ſhe has gain'd every bodies good will; but ſhe is much miſtaken; for her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage has ſo moved all againſt her that know her, that I ſhould be much perplexed to name one only perſon who has any eſteem or good will for her, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hortenſia,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Late Dutcheſs <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
                  </note> who is a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59422:92"/>Child, ſhe has won by force of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and giving her Money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; having found, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſome Treaſure, ſeeing ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take Money which I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Madam de <hi>Venelle</hi> to pay her in what quantity ſhe pleas'd when ſhe went to <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt good fortune which can happen to this Perſon, is my not deferring any longer to regulate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and if I cannot make her wiſe, as I believe it's impoſſible, at leaſt, that her follies appear not any more in the view of the World, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe will run a risk of being torn in pieces.</p>
               <p>You hear all this with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the affection you have for her will not ſuffer you to ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in what relates to her; but as for my part, who am not prejudiced, and who, at what price ſoever, will ſerve you in this accident, which is the moſt important of your whole life, tho' it ſhould coſt me mine: I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59422:93"/>ſee the truth as it is, and I will not ſuffer you to be ruin'd; for otherwiſe I ſhould be guilty of a kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let the event be what it will, I matter not to dye, provided it be doing my duty, and ſerving you, as I am oblig'd, eſpecially in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein no body can do it better.</p>
               <p>I had forgot to tell you, that to diſcover to you the better the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this perſon has for me, that ſhe has never writ to me but two words, forced to do it by Madam de <hi>Venelle;</hi> and after the ſight of you at St. <hi>John d'Angely,</hi> another Letter, which I know to be an effect of what you told her, being well aſſured, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the favour you bear me, you omit nothing to oblige her to render me all kinds of reſpects and marks of affection. But whatever power you have over her Mind, you will never ſucceed in this point, and I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you it will be in vain. And moreover, how can you pretend ſhe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59422:93"/>has any deference and affection to me, whoſe thoughts are quite contrary to hers; which is to ſay, ſhe is for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Libertine and an Extravagant, and I on the contrary would have her to be Wiſe and Reſerv'd.</p>
               <p>I do not doubt but ſhe knows all that I have the Honour to write to you, but ſo far am I from being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of it, that there's nothing I more paſſionately wiſh for; and would to God ſhe were capable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering you pertinently on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which you take care to impart to her, for I earneſtly wiſh to be free from that trouble. But I confeſs to you that at the Age I am, and among all the Employments with which I am o'rewhelm'd, and in which I ſeem ſo fortunate to ſerve you with Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Advantage to your State; I cannot bear the being tormented by a Perſon, who ſhould by all Laws ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her ſelf to comfort me; and that which afflicts me to the utmoſt, is, that in ſtead of ſparing me this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59422:94"/>trouble, you contribute thereunto, in giving to this Wretch, by the paſſion you ſhew her, the courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to live as ſhe does.</p>
               <p>I was wholly at eaſe by what you took the pains to write me, and by the Conduct you began to hold ſince my diſpatch from <hi>Cadillac;</hi> and I had believ'd that you only thought of preparing the ways to be happy in your Marriage, which could not be but in maſtering of your Paſſion, which had made it ſelf Maſter of your Mind. But I have ſeen with a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpleaſure, that after this fatal Viſit, which I would have hindered at the price of my Blood, all is fall'n into a worſe condition than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and you muſt not explain to me the thing otherwiſe, for I cannot doubt of it, and I may ſay, I know all as well as you. Pray conſider after this, in what condition I am, and whether there be in the World a Man more wretched than my ſelf, who, after applying himſelf continually
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59422:94"/>with the greateſt zeal to raiſe your Reputation, and to procure by all ways the glory of your Arms, the eaſe of your Subjects, and the good of your State, has the diſpleaſure to ſee a Perſon who belongs to me, on the very point of overturning all, and cauſing your Ruine, if you go on to give way to your paſſion for her. When I call to mind what you were pleas'd to write me, That if you could explain your ſelf by word of Mouth, I ſhould have an entire ſatisfaction touching the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of your Mind, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to do, without reſerve, whatever. I ſhould ſee neceſſary for your Glory, and the good of the Kingdom; it makes me deſperate to ſee this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce laſt, which hinders me from waiting on you, and endeavouring, according to your orders, to calm your Spirit, and put you in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being the happieſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt Monarch in the World; but I know not how to approach you, having reaſon to believe that neither
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59422:95"/>of us ſhall ſay any thing to content one another. For can I without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Fidelity I owe you, and without betraying my Obligations, abſtain from ſhewing you, that you take a courſe quite contrary to what is decent, and to the Happineſs you ſhould aſpire after; ſeeing that at the very point of marrying your ſelf, you abandon your ſelf more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to your Paſſion; for whatever power you have over your ſelf, and whatever progreſs you may have made through her counſel whom you love, in the art of diſſembling, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceal your averſion to this Marriage, although it be the moſt profitable and glorious you can make. How can I forbear telling you, that you prejudice the good of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that you draw on you the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of all the World, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelf liable to the wrath of God, if you marry with a Princeſs whom you do not love, and in the intention of living ill with her, as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59422:95"/>the other Perſon threatens. Do you believe that God can bleſs ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and that, if you deal thus, you can avoid the feeling as many effects of his Indignation as he has ſhew'd you hitherto of his Bounty? I ſhould deceive you, ſhould I not condemn the Conduct you hold, and the care you take to make your ſelf miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing that inſtead of ſoftly breaking off, as you have begun to do, a Commerce, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obſtacle to the ſatisfaction which you will receive from the Marriage which I treat on, you have renewed it with more heat than ever, without conſidering that you are going to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe the Greateſt and moſt Virtuous Princeſs in the World; that ſhe has had an inclination for you from the Cradle; that there is nothing ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious in the preſent Conjuncture for the Proſperity of your Affairs; that ſhe is well ſhaped, and that the Beauty of her Mind comes not ſhort of that of her Body.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59422:96"/>
               <p>It is hereupon, if I were near you, I would conjure you to tell me, if there be not ſufficient to ſatisfie you in the poſſeſſion of this Princeſs, who, without doubt, will adore you, for all the excellent Qualities you poſſeſs, but that another Paſſion, which you ſo carefully cultivate, is to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a great defect. For one may truly ſay, that the Perſon you dote on comes not near the Beauty either of Mind or Body of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs who is to be your Spouſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, ſhe is infinitely above her in Quality and Birth.</p>
               <p>Were I with you, I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear remembring you of what you have ſaid your ſelf in ſeveral rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the occaſion of the Marriage of the Marqueſs of <hi>Richlieu;</hi> that there is nothing more ſhameful and odious than a diſagreeable Marriage.</p>
               <p>I ſhould never be weary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding you, with the reſpect I owe you, that the thoughts you have, and which the perſon in queſtion pretends

               <p>But when it ſhould be true, that this only motive induced you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, would it be juſt that I ſhould ſo far forget my ſelf, as to conſent that for my particular Intereſt, and for the raiſing of my Reputation, I ſhould ſuffer you to loſe yours. In truth, my Ambition puts me not on do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Action which may redound to my Glory; and I ought the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be thus affected, in that, beſides
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59422:97"/>my Duty, your particular Favours oblige me hereunto. In fine, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my Return, for aſſuredly I cannot entertain you to your like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor forbear telling you with great heat, what I now write to you, and other things more earneſt on this Head.</p>
               <p>I find my ſelf then much perplex'd about what will become of me; and much more in giving the laſt ſtroak in reference to your Marriage; for methinks I promiſe what is not, and that I contribute to the eſtabliſhment of a thing which will make an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon miſerable, who deſerves your Affection; and your ſelf likewiſe, becauſe you will be ſo.</p>
               <p>It is time to render your ſelf, and to declare your will without diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is better a thouſand times to break all off, and to continue the War, without any concern for the Miſeries of Chriſtendom, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which your Countries will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, than to make this Marriage
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59422:97"/>for your misfortune, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the whole Kingdom. And though I continue to labour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the buſineſs, this ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from executing what you will pleaſe to command me hereupon. Yet I confeſs, I ſhall do it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and with a ſenſible diſpleaſure, if I do not ſee at the ſame time that you do what is neceſſary to find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the Marriage in hand. Then will I do what God ſhall inſpire me for your good; that I may not fail in any thing which may depend on me to contribute to the ſatisfaction which I wiſh you in this Marriage, which cannot be any thing elſe but what I wrote you from <hi>Cadillac</hi> very preciſely, after having well examined and reſolved on what I ſignified to you.</p>
               <p>And the better to make you know, that the paſſion which you have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders you from reliſhing the pleaſure, which you ſhould feel in Eſpouſing ſo great, handſom, and compleat a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59422:98"/>I will add, that you were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved, or to ſpeak better, wiſht at <hi>Lyons</hi> to Eſpouſe the Princeſs <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerite</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whoſe beauty and quality are not comparable to the Infanta's; and you may remember, if you pleaſe, that you were angry at what the Queen and others ſaid to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt you.</p>
               <p>Here is whatever the paſſion, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the zeal which I have for your ſervice and happineſs, conſtrain me to repreſent with the liberty which I owe as an old Servant, who breaths after nothing but your Glory, and who has more intereſt and obligation than any other; not only to tell you the truth, but likewiſe to ſacrifice his life for ſo good a Maſter.</p>
               <p>As to what remains, I proteſt to you, that nothing is capable to hinder me from dying with ſadneſs, ſhould I ſee a perſon, who is ſo nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, to cauſe you more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and damage, than I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you ſervices from the firſt day I began to ſerve you.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59422:98"/>
               <p>I will likewiſe tell you, that I have great affairs in hand, as you know, but that there is certainly none of ſo great importance as this, and which requires more earneſtly an end. And therefore, if need were, I would lay aſide all others, and only labour at this.</p>
               <p>I conjure you to read this Letter with attention, and to do me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to denote to me your intentions without any reſerve, to the end I may take the reſolutions which I ſhall judge moſt proper and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for your ſervice.</p>

               <p>I Have made a very good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent uſe of the Letter which I entreated the Confident and you to write to me to ſhew Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that part where you ſay you could wiſh he knew as well the Prince's humour as you and I do; for then the Conferences would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Chriſtendom enjoy the bleſſed effects of the ſo long deſired Peace. For he told me, that the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he ſaw ſtill, her ill opinion of this Prince; and I could eaſily perceive your Letters and thoſe of Monſieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> made a great impreſſion on his ſpirit. I write to you by this Footman, and will do it to Morrow
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59422:99"/>Morning by <hi>Bartet,</hi> by whom I intend to inform the Confident and you of whatever paſt in Yeſterday's Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Yet I muſt profeſs to you, I am overcharged and greatly fear I ſhall not be able to go through ſo much buſineſs.</p>
               <p>I am obliged particularly to tell you, that it ſeems to me, from what I have gathered from Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, that they are very willing at <hi>Madrid</hi> to refer the Concluſion of the Marriage to the Month of <hi>March.</hi> Every body is agreed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> will greatly expoſe himſelf, if at his Age, and with all his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions, he ſhould undertake ſo troubleſom a Journey in Winter; and that the intention of Don <hi>Lewis</hi> is to ſign and proclaim the Peace, without any more delay, and to do the ſame in reſpect of the Articles of Marriage, and then return to come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the King his Maſter in the Month of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe the Confident, in humour
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59422:100"/>wherein he is at preſent (for I well know he has more paſſion than ever) will be very glad of this delay: and we ſhall have more time by this means to tend his cure; for I declare to you, if he marries in that diſpoſition of mind he now is in, he will be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the Infanta yet more, and you and I beyond all hopes. I have written to him a Letter of about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or eighteen Pages, and I wiſh he would let you read it. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 'twill not pleaſe him; however, I could not omit it, without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own Conſcience and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For I proteſt to you, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, I would rather chuſe a thouſand times to retire with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as I have written to him from <hi>Cadillac,</hi> and thereby contribute to his cure, by ſacrificing my Perſon and all that I have, than to live near him, and ſee him unhappy, and out of a capacity of being the moſt Glorious and Compleateſt Prince in the World, as I wiſh he may, and will certainly
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59422:100"/>be, if it be not his own fault. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, I am aſhamed to tell Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> in relation to the Marriage, ſeveral things contrary to truth, to the prejudice of a Princeſs, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controverſie deſerves the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident's affection.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs to you how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this afflicts me, the thoughts of it not letting me take a minutes reſt; and that which drives me to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſpair, is, that all my misfortune comes from a Perſon from whom I might otherwiſe expect to receive comfort. It is, Madam, your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that keeps me alive, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance I have in you, and likewiſe a little hope, that the Confident will at length come to himſelf. I ſhall ſee it by the anſwer he makes me, but more by the conduct he holds, for hereupon I ſhall without any more loſs of time take my meaſures. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat you to ſend me ſpeedily word how you find him affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Marriage, and whether he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59422:101"/>is for having it in <hi>October, November,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> to the end, that I may take ſuch courſes as your Letters ſhall direct me.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59422:106"/>to him he had orders from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty to ſpare no coſt to haſten things, and had already paid out Two Hundred Thouſand Crowns for the Liveries of his Majeſties Houſhold, and the Livery of his Guards, which conſiſt of Three Companies of an Hundred Gentlemen each, one of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> another of <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and the other of <hi>Germans.</hi> I have learnt ſince that this is the real cauſe of this delay, Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel</hi> having freely told me as much, by the order of Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who came the other day to viſit me here. He told me among other things, that ſhould the King of <hi>Spain</hi> give a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Gold more, he could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haſten the preparations Four Days; that the great Lords who muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily accompany him, by reaſon of their Offices, were forced to ſend to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> to get their Cloaths and Liveries made.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſpeaking to me of this attendance of Perſons of Quality on
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59422:107"/>both ſides, gave me to underſtand the Two Kings would do well to bring along with them only ſuch a number as would be abſolutely neceſſary, whereby they might ſhorten their Journey, and leſſen the expence of their Subjects, who had been at great charge already by the War.</p>
               <p>I upheld his Diſcourſe, ſaying, That the King had already thank'd moſt of the Perſons of the higheſt Rank in his Kingdom, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to wait on him with all the Splendour uſual on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; ſo that his Majeſty would bring ſcarcely any one along with him beyond what is neceſſary for his actual Service.</p>
               <p>He much approved of this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I believe it will not be his fault if his Maſter does not do the ſame; and I ſuppoſe I have very well palliated the truth of what paſſes in your Court, which is empty enough of perſons of Quality for this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſeeing the Princes, Dukes, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59422:107"/>Peers, and other Officers of the Crown excuſe themſelves from this Journey from the reaſons you know.</p>
               <p>I told afterwards Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> that according to the Overture he had made, neither the Catholick King, nor the Infanta would be much concerned, if in the neceſſity there was of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time in this conjuncture, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not ſent of the ſame Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> nor with the Splendour he ſhew'd in this occaſion, ſeeing the Perſon on whom his Majeſty might caſt his Eye might ride Poſt, that I had diſpatch'd a Currier to the King, to propoſe to him the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont,</hi> who beſides his Birth, was Duke and Peer, and an Officer of the Crown, ſpake <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and who in my judgment, had all the Qualities requiſite for this Employ. Whereupon he aſſured me, he ſhould be very glad if his Majeſty would make this choice.</p>
               <p>He afterwards ſpake to me of the Dowry, and drew a Letter out of his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59422:108"/>Pocket which Don <hi>Antonio Pimentel</hi> had writ to him from <hi>Lyons,</hi> in which he ſignified to him, that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him about the Dowry, I had hinted, That part of it might be raiſed from the Conqueſts which the King had made ſince the rupture of the Negotiation of <hi>Madrid.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he enlarg'd himſelf, according to his uſual manner, exaggerating the great Advantages which <hi>France</hi> would draw from this Peace, and that the leaſt thing the King could do was to accept of the Dowry from theſe Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I had charg'd <hi>Pimentel</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> to write in the manner he had done, in the belief they would never pretend in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Infanta ſhould make a general renunciation of what ever might appertain to her in certain occaſions; and he had been told, we intended not to reſtore a Finger's breadth of Land of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King's Arms had conquer'd ſince the year 1656; and I not only
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59422:108"/>confirm'd to Don <hi>Lowis</hi> the ſame thing I had told <hi>Pimentel,</hi> but I farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him, that thinking it juſt to do for the ſake of ſo great a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſomething more than what had been done for the Sieur <hi>Pimentel;</hi> I therefore declared to him, that after having yielded on the point of the Renunciation, the King would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to give to his Catholick Majeſty not one part of the Dowry, but the whole, for ſome of the Conqueſts we had made ſince that time, provided they entirely remained in our hands. He replyed to me, he thought we had 'em entirely, ſeeing that inſtead of <hi>Valentia, Mortaria, Oudenarde,</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> which were agreed to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred as well as <hi>Dixinude, Menin,</hi> and <hi>Comines,</hi> which I well knew to be Poſts not able to hold out Four Days againſt him that ſhould be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Field; he yielded us <hi>Thion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, Damvilliers, Bethune, La Baſſee,</hi> and <hi>le Queſnoy,</hi> which were agreed on at <hi>Madrid</hi> to be reſtor'd, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59422:109"/>moreover <hi>Heſdin,</hi> which was the ſtrongeſt and moſt important place, which <hi>Spain</hi> could yield up to <hi>France,</hi> beſides the Bailiwicks of <hi>Artois, Aire,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> which conſiſt of to great a number of Villages, that they reach further than twenty Leagues, and which render the King Maſter of a Province the more conſiderable in that it borders on <hi>France,</hi> adding, That I had farther the addreſs to draw from <hi>Pimentel</hi> the Provoſtſhip of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and Wardenſhip of <hi>Bourborg,</hi> on which we had not the leaſt reaſon for a pretenſion.</p>
               <p>But though there be nothing more true than what he told me hereupon, and that what we draw hence is worth without queſtion the double of what we yield; yet I boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, and without fearing to be taken at my word, conſidering the knowledge I have of their intereſts and intentions, that he would give me occaſion to merit greatly with the King; if he would inſiſt both
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59422:109"/>parties ſhould keep in reference to the Conqueſts to what was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the King retain what his Arms have acquired ſince that time.</p>
               <p>But it concerns 'em ſo greatly not to leave us a Foot in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> nor pieces, as <hi>Oudenarde</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> which are capable of keeping always Peoples minds reſtleſs, that I did not doubt but he would anſwer me as he did: That we ſhould hold what had been determined, and that the queſtion being only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Money, he did not believe it was for the King his Maſter's Honour to diſpute on that Head; as he alſo believed, I could what Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> had ſaid to Don <hi>Pedro Coloma,</hi> to augment the Sum of the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which was given to the Queen, which would not work the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at preſent as it did then, becauſe Money was in that time ſcarcer than now.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:59422:110"/>
               <p>I replied to him, I ſhould not do the King a pleaſure, ſhould I ſtop a moment on an affair of this nature for the ſame reaſon he had told me, that it was not for the honour of ſo great a King to contend for more or leſs of Money; and I told him in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if he would take the pains to defray the charge which would be made in this occaſion, I would give him a faithful account of it, and we would take nothing for the Dowry. He might indeed tell me juſtly, that if any Princeſs were married without a Dowry, it ſhould be the Infanta, by reaſon of the excellent qualities ſhe poſſeſt. That which I am afraid will give us the greateſt trouble, is, that the valuation of Five Hundred Thouſand Crowns, which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Queen, was made in Silver, which is to ſay, in Rials: and as in that time the Crowns in Gold were not worth much more than the half of what they are now, we ſhall come to loſe above Twelve Hundred Thouſand
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59422:110"/>Livers, ſhould they pay us in this manner: in which perhaps they would not be ill grounded, ſeeing the words of the Contract converting into Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Crowns of Gold, ſay the like Sum ſhould be given in Rials. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have thought of a way how to make our reaſons paſs and extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my ſelf out of this affair to the King's advantage, remembring I have heard him ſay, when 'twas diſcourſed that the Daughter of <hi>la Baziniere</hi> had 500000 Crowns Portion, that he did not believe her whom he ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would have more. For if I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the thing, as I hope to do in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king be valued the Crowns in Gold mention'd in the contract on the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent price of our Crowns, the Sum will amount very near to three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers; which will come ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeaſonable to ſtop a gap of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which we cannot be exempted from in paying almoſt the like Sum to be given the Arch Dukes for <hi>Alſace,</hi> which is yielded to us by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:59422:111"/>
               <p>Having ſpent almoſt two hours in regulating whatever concern'd the Marriage, and ſupputing the preciſe time, in which the Infanta might be here with the King her Father, Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> to whom his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has deſign'd this honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own report, very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly told me (having perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered within himſelf, we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome ſuſpicion on the delaying the Infanta's Journey, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating the Marriage) that we ſhould without any more ado ſign, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, and proclaim the peace, ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the diſpenſation, ſign here the Articles of the Marriage, and in general, perform all that is neceſſary to engage the Prince, ſo that no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may make him change; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me that on their ſide, they would uſe their utmoſt endeavours to gain time.</p>
               <p>We muſt not wonder at the care Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has taken to ſpeak to me after this manner, being perſwaded
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59422:111"/>the King moſt paſſionately deſires to ſee this affair ended, conſidering him as a Gallant who impatiently expects the hour he is to ſee his Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I believ'd this Conference would have paſt without his returning to the charge on the point of Monſieur the Prince; but having repeated to me the Declaration he had made me in the two preceeding, he began by profeſſing he was much perplexed in this Affair, not only for the reaſons he had with great prolixity deduced to me heretofore, but like wiſe becauſe this Prince had ordered his Agents who are here to ſolicit nothing, but to approve entirely whatever Don <hi>Lewis</hi> would do touching his intereſts. So that he found himſelf at preſent his Plenipotentiary, but at the ſame time incapacitated to procure him any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>He agreed with me, that this was a cunning piece of dexterity for the Prince to do thus in a deſperate caſe, to try whether this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59422:112"/>might procure him any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which he could not hope for by any other means. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his diſcourſe, he inſiſted more than ever he had done, That I would like Monſieur the Prince ſhould come here, and that ſeeing our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we might be good Friends, which is what he moſt paſſionately deſired; that he Don <hi>Lewis</hi> greatly wiſht the ſame, as likewiſe to ſee this Prince the moſt faithful and zealous Servant the King can have: That he believ'd as this was for the advantage of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, ſo it was no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to his Majeſties Service and my credit He afterwards much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the ſincerity, with which this Prince would faithfully and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually execute, whatever he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in relation to the King, and my Perſon in particular, and on the juſt apprehenſion of being undone if he dealt otherwiſe; ſeeing he would not have only the King's power to fear, but moreover the reſentment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59422:112"/>of his Catholick Majeſty, the Infanta and of him Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who would become his greateſt Enemies, ſhould he fail in the leaſt particluar he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>To which I replied, That being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his good intentions, and the freedom with which he ſpake to me; I had all the grateful ſenſe which I ought; but that it was fit his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ſhould know ſomething might ſo happen in <hi>France,</hi> That not only the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> would have a mind to ſtir, but that he would do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mattering the complaints, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Excellency might make againſt him, provided he therein found his advantage; ſeeing it had been ſeen by experience, as this Prince knew perhaps better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Cabals, Commotions, and Revolutions of <hi>France</hi> had never deeper roots, nor produced greater effects to the prejudice of its Kings, than when it did not appear they had any relation to <hi>Spain;</hi> becauſe the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59422:113"/>
                  <hi>French,</hi> generally ſpeaking, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prone to engage themſelves in the Commotions exited by the great ones of the Kingdom for particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; but regard with horror what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to the making them enter into a Confederacy with Strangers, and eſpecially <hi>Spaniards;</hi> from whence his Excellency might eaſily perceive whether there is reaſon to believe, that Monſieur the Prince could be withheld by the fear of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty and his Excellency, in caſe he had a mind to do miſchief, and an opportunity offered.</p>
               <p>He afterwards urged me to tell him whether 'twas not poſſible for ſome ſecurity to be granted to the Prince, as he knew had been given in <hi>France</hi> in ſeveral occaſions to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of leſs quality than he. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered there was no Example of this uſage to any body, except the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, to whom the good of the State and other conſiderations requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the giving ſome places which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59422:113"/>have ſince been drawn out of their hands; that his ſecurity had been provided for by what had been inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his favour in the Treaty ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that it was his own fault he had not a greater, ſeeing that returning with a Reſolution to live well, and to ſerve faithfully the King, not only he had nothing to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but might expect favours from his bounty and generoſity; of which he had leſs reaſon to doubt than any body, having had more experience of this than any Subject beſides.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> preſt me afreſh, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King that Monſieur the Prince might come hither, ſaying for this he would owe me the greateſt reſpect, and hereby all would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Prince's ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>I anſwered it depended on him to give it himſelf in fifteen days time, and I ſhould have the honour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him my ſelf to the King and Queen; and that he had nothingelſe to do but to accept of the favours
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59422:114"/>which the King and Queen offered him by the Treaty: and this anſwer was the cauſe he ſpake to me no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; but it was I who purſued the matter, making him dextrouſly value the Overture I had made him to uſe my endeavours with the King to give ſome recompence in <hi>France</hi> to Monſieur the Prince, if he gave himſelf his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand thereto, in caſting himſelf at the King's Feet, and remitting to his Majeſty the places which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King ſhould give him; which I did with the addreſs I have already mention'd to you, informing him that my propoſing this Expedient had no other motive but the drawing his Excellency out of the perplexity he ſeemed to be in; though I well knew I ſhould have a great deal of trouble to make the King reliſh it, becauſe Monſieur the Prince would owe all the obligation of the favours I might procure him from the King to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty chuſing rather generouſly to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59422:114"/>beſtow ſome on him in another time, when he ſhall deſerve them, than to grant him 'em at preſent, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for what he ſhould yield to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>I farther added, That if he liked to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd me <hi>Caillet,</hi> I would make him value the firmneſs with which his Excellency acted in favour of Monſieur the Prince; and that I might moreover engage him to make me Propoſitions more poſitive than thoſe he had made me going and coming from his Maſter, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the King the Places which his Catholick Majeſty ſhould give him.</p>
               <p>But he told me, he would have no body meddle in this Affair but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he ſeemed to me more tortured at my having reduced him to the point of making me neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily know that he had no intention of giving ſuch like Recompence to the Prince, or that he had done it for an ill end; that is to ſay, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59422:115"/>him always dependent on the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to put him into a condition to make one day uſe of ſuch an Eſtabliſhment, to the great damage and diſſervice of this Crown.</p>
               <p>And I preſs'd him in this occaſion more than I had done in any before; telling him, That if the Prince and his Agents could diſcover the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I had made him, they would not let him reſt a day till they had prevail'd with him to take me at my word, for otherwiſe they would not have ſtuck to have taken it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Excellency never had the thought really to oblige Monſieur the Prince, ſeeing if he had in truth for him the kindneſs he pretended, he ſhould be glad of this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of manding his Fortune.</p>
               <p>It's certain, had I let <hi>Lainet</hi> or <hi>Caillet</hi> know what paſs'd on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, 'twould have hapned either that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> muſt have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to their importunities, which would have turn'd to the advantage
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59422:115"/>of the King, or that they would have come to Daggers drawn, after which the Prince muſt have ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ill ſatisfied with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> As Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had reſerved himſelf to make me ſome Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well on what regarded Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, as on the exchange of <hi>Bergue</hi> and <hi>la Baſſee, Pimentel</hi> came, and after having entertain'd me twice long enough on theſe two points, having among other things laid down, that the Wardenſhip of <hi>Bergue</hi> had nothing in common with <hi>Bergue,</hi> and that thus this place muſt be reckoned for nothing, ſeeing 'twas agreed on it ſhould be razed at the inſtant it ſhould be remitted. I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived this tended to the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me nothing in exchange; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpake to him ſo deciſively on this point, and what regarded Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, that having ſaid he would inform Don <hi>Lewis</hi> of it, to the end he might diſcourſe with me about it in this days Conference, he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59422:116"/>return'd without daring to make me the Propoſition he was charg'd with, judging well, that I might be nettled with it, and make ſome anſwer which might vex Don <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forgot hitherto to impart to their Majeſties, that the Miniſter of <hi>England</hi> who reſides in <hi>Spain,</hi> and is at preſent with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into my Lodging to make me a viſit, without ſending me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand the leaſt word of it, uſed ſo familiarly with me, that he came up to my Chamber without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremony, as if we had been the beſt friends in the World, or that the King his Maſter had been at <hi>Paris</hi> in the King's Intereſts, as he is at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in thoſe of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> I ſent word to him by <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaux,</hi> that I could not receive him, having had in theſe beginnings occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to apprehend that ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a proceeding muſt have been concerted with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> to give to Mr. <hi>Locker</hi> ſome jealouſie,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59422:116"/>which might cauſe a change in our Affairs with the Common-Wealth of <hi>England.</hi> However, I cauſed this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to be told in his Ear, that I thought I could better ſerve his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in behaving my ſelf as I did, than if I dealt otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſador <hi>Locker</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to know of Don <hi>Lewis</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might ſee him purſuant to the Orders he had of his Superiours, to inform him their intention was to live in peace with all, and that he was furniſh'd with power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it with his Excellency, in caſe his Excellency had likewiſe power from the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told all this to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who anſwer'd me, he might go to <hi>Andaye,</hi> and that ſending his Gentleman to demand Audience the next day, he would give it him at the hour he appointed; and upon my telling him he ſhould take care no diſorder hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by reaſon there were <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> at <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> Don <hi>Lewis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59422:117"/>me to aſſure him he might rely on his Word.</p>
               <p>I ſhall end this Diſpatch by the recital of an Adventure which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned during the laſt Conference to the Abbot <hi>Siri</hi> in Don <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the preſence of moſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Lords.</p>
               <p>This Abbot diſcourſing with one Don <hi>Chriſtoval,</hi> Secretary of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who talks with great freedom, and is wholly devoted to the Prince's Intereſts, and as ſuch a great Friend of <hi>Lainet</hi>'s: Don <hi>Chriſtoval</hi> violently fell upon <hi>Pimentel,</hi> calling him an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> for having made the Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> and blaming highly Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> for having employed in an Affair of this importance a Man that did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the World; and moreover for having ratified this Treaty, and undertaken ſo long a Journey to Sign the moſt diſadvantagious Peace as <hi>Spain</hi> ever made; adding, 'twould have been better for his Reputation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59422:117"/>he had ſhut himſelf up in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Carmelit</hi> Friers, which is a place where Don <hi>Lewis</hi> often goes when he is at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Not content with this, he enters on retailing the particular Articles of the Peace, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the great advantages the King of <hi>France</hi> would make of the Peace, and the irreparable prejudices redounding thereby to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he ſaw on the point of abandoning a Prince who had ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully ſerv'd him, having been the chief Inſtrument in all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions which the Arms of <hi>Spain</hi> had performed ſince the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
               <p>To which the Abbot <hi>Siri</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the terms he ought, to diſabuſe him; the other began to attack him on his Hiſtory, even to the telling him plainly, that when he publiſh'd it, the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> who was Embaſſadour at <hi>Venice,</hi> was much to blame, in not having uſed weighty Reaſons (by which he meant
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59422:118"/>
                  <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtols) to engage the Author to write in a manner more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to ſuppreſs the Fictions he uttered in favour of <hi>France;</hi> and if you had to do with me, ſaid he, and you would not come to Reaſon, I ſhould not have ſtuck to have ſent you into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. And then falling again on Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> he affirm'd, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſending the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> on an Embaſſy to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he ſhould have ſent for him home, and made him be ſeverely puniſh'd; and the Abbot not having ſpoken well of Count <hi>de Sirvela,</hi> Don <hi>Chriſtoval</hi> ſet upon him again for that. But the Abbot anſwer'd, that he could not ſpeak otherwiſe of that Miniſter, who had behaved himſelf very ill in ſeveral Rencounters, and that having inſerted in his Hiſtory, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had caus'd <hi>Boccalin</hi> to be kill'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> becauſe he would not be prevail'd on to write after their manner; if ſuch a misfortune
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59422:118"/>ſhould happen to him, there would ariſe ſome other Hiſtorian who would have writ it, ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be more decried for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. And the concluſion was, that he did not marvel to ſee Don <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> ſo angry at the Peace, on there not being given the Prince all the Advantages he pretended to; in as much as the <hi>French</hi> knew as well as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that he receiv'd Twelve Thouſand Crowns Penſion from this Prince.</p>
               <p>But that which was moſt pleaſant was, that Don <hi>Chriſtoval,</hi> who is a <hi>German,</hi> born in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> and whom the Abbot <hi>Siri</hi> believ'd to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Spaniard,</hi> affirming they had committed a great overſight in giving the Infanta to the King, becauſe if the Emperour had had her with the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> he could have made War with <hi>France,</hi> with an Army of Fifty or Threeſcore Thouſand Men, which would have put the King of <hi>Spain</hi> into a condition to make on
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59422:119"/>all ſides ſuch progreſſes as he could deſire. The Abbot <hi>Siri</hi> replyed to him, there were no better way in the World to make the King ſoon Maſter of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> for theſe Fifty or Sixty Thouſand Drunkards would have only ſerv'd to enrage the People, and make 'em put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the King's Protection, who would aſſuredly more apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crafts and Artifices of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who only hereby maintain'd themſelves in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> than all the great Armies which the Emperour could have employed on that ſide.</p>
               <p>Then Don <hi>Chriſtoval,</hi> in parting from the Abbot <hi>Siri,</hi> gave him a Lozenge, which he immediately put into the hands of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who was near him, ſaying, he was not ſuch a Fool to put it into his mouth, coming from a Man who ſo lately told him, that if he had been at <hi>Venice,</hi> he would have ſent him into the other World.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59422:119"/>

               <p>I Juſt now receiv'd your Letter, with the Copies of thoſe which the King and King of <hi>Spain</hi> are to write to <hi>Rome;</hi> and having nothing to reply thereupon, I ſhall content my ſelf in telling you, that I have been in no ways ſatisfied with the viſit of Monſieur <hi>Pimentel;</hi> for inſtead of coming here laden with Expedients and Propoſitions to agree in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in what remains to be adjuſted, his Diſcourſe had no other aim but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59422:120"/>to preſs me vigorouſly to concur in ſatisfying Monſieur the Prince; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting to me, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Don <hi>Lewis</hi> would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereby exceſſively oblig'd to me; and repeating to me all the Reaſons Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had laid before me in our ſeveral Conferences, and to which I think I have ſufficiently anſwer'd.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge I was oblig'd to anſwer him with ſome ſmartneſs, and I hope he will relate whatever I ſaid to him to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> without forgetting any thing. We muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely make an end one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this great delay brings an irreparable prejudice to the King's Affairs; and whatever Don <hi>Lewis</hi> can alledge to the contrary, I am aſſured, that his Reputation and mine ſuffer very much by it; for we ſhall find it an hard matter to ſhew what we have done conſiderable in all our Conferences.</p>
               <p>It's true, that as to my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, my Heart is at reſt, in as
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59422:120"/>much as it has not been my fault that we have not ended all things in one Conference. Not only I have omitted nothing to haſten Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> but the laſt time we ſaw one another, I told him again with great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the more or leſs ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Monſieur the Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd not the deferring for one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour the putting an end to the Sufferings of Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Neither could I forbear telling the Sieur <hi>Pimentel,</hi> that I came in the belief I ſhould not ſee the Senior Don <hi>Lewis</hi> thrice, not only without ending together whatever remained to do for the Peace, but likewiſe without diſpatching the greateſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs relating to the good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, the Glory of the Kings our Maſters, and the Advantage of their Subjects. After an attentive hearing of this, he told me, he would make a relation of it to Don <hi>Lewis;</hi> and would afterwards ſend

               </argument>
               <p>AT the Inſtant I received your Letter, I take my Pen to give my ſelf the Honour of telling you, That though the anſwer be ſuccinct enough, yet I know eaſily thereby your intentions, and diſpoſition of mind. Your goodneſs has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you till now, to write to me, nor ſpeak to me as you do in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: yet I am not ſurpriſed at it, for ſince <hi>Lyons,</hi> I have ever doubted, that if I were not ſacrificed to the Perſon you know, I ſhould be to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. If you have taken the pains to examine my Letter, you will ſee therein ſufficient occaſion to thank me for what I have wrote to you from an indiſpenſable and pure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of your Service, Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59422:122"/>and you would not treat me like an extravagant Perſon, as you do, in telling me I have an ill opinion of you, and that I believe you to be a Lyar. I ſhould not deſerve to live, ſhould I have ſuch like thoughts of my Maſter; but I ſpeak the truth, without being wanting in the reſpect I owe you, when I affirm that the paſſion you have for the Perſon you love, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders you from ſeeing her defects, and that I know ſhe hates me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what you have been pleaſed to ſignifie to me to the contrary. For without doing you any wrong, I believe I know her better than any body alive. If you are angry with me, as you expreſs in the beginning of your Letter, you need only order me the place where I ſhould come to feel the marks of your indignation, and I will not fail therein. At leaſt be ſure, I ſhall without reluctancy, loudly publiſh that you have reaſon for what you do, and that I only am to blame. Yet I hope you are too

I humbly entreat your pardon, if I have been too importunate with you, aſſuring you I will not be ſo for the time to come. As to the reſt, to abridge the time of your Marriage, I ſhall ſign the Articles of it, and thoſe of the Peace, according to your orders, after which I will go and end my days at the place you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn me; content with the happineſs of having ſerved for 30 Years the King your Father and your ſelf, your Arms nor affairs having loſt any of their reputation.

               <p>I Have already ſignified to you, that I had no great account to give you, to inform their Majeſties of what paſt in the laſt Conference, which laſted not above half ſo long as the others.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing Don <hi>Lewis</hi> askt me, was, whether I would diſpatch a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman into <hi>Portugal,</hi> as I had told him I would, to impart to the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> what had been inſerted in the Treaty concerning him; and I told him I thought it not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to haſten this Envoy, altho' the Gentleman was ready, and had the King's Diſpatches before I came here: It being imprudent to ſend News, which moſt certainly would not have a welcome reception in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> without firſt ending whatever concern'd Monſieur the Prince, whoſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59422:125"/>intereſts his Excellency ſtill maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch heat and conſtancy; though in truth I ſhould reſt ſatisfied with the reiterated Declarations he had made me, That this point ſhould not in any fort retard the proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and execution of the Peace.</p>
               <p>He afterwards perſwaded me to lay aſide all ſuſpicion of the Succeſs of this Negotiation; and that I ſhould no longer defer theſending away this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, becauſe perhaps the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who is of the Family of the <hi>Guſmans,</hi> and his Couſin German; ſeeing an impoſſibility of maintaining her Son in the State he is in, after the Peace concluded between the two Crowns, might reſolve on having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Catholick King's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, to ſhelter her Perſon and all her Family from the inevitable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which threatned them; and thus he might be freed from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bringing Troops from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> to form a great Army to be employed in the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:59422:126"/>
               <p>I could eaſily perceive by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in which he much enlarged himſelf, he could wiſh this War were ended rather by a Treaty than Arms: and I believe if the Queen of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> would take this courſe, ſhe might greatly advantage the condition of her Son and her ſelf, in returning her ſelf a Subject of <hi>Spain;</hi> which is what I ſhall not fail to acquaint this Queen with, to the end that conſidering well in what condition affairs will be in after the Peace, ſhe may take that reſolution ſhe ſhall judge moſt proper.</p>
               <p>Neither do I doubt, but if ſhe would have elſewhere the recompence of her Son's and her Eſtate in that Country, and even with Uſury, and alſo any thing elſe fitting for her, ſhe might eaſily obtain it; ſeeing Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has told me in ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, that if ſhe would be content to have conferred on her Son the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and other Honours of this nature, he believed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59422:126"/>the King his Maſter would grant 'em them for the ſake of the Peace, and the ceſſation of all hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>I hereupon took occaſion to draw advantage from our Entertainment, in acquainting Don <hi>Lewis</hi> that I was willing to do him a pleaſure to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the ſaid Envoy. I dexterouſly engaged him to grant me a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuſpenſion of Arms from the part of the King his Maſter for the whole Month of <hi>December</hi> with <hi>Portugal;</hi> although according to what had been determined at <hi>Paris,</hi> it ſhould end at the concluſion of the next Month; which certainly is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantagious in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> for hereby he has more time to prepare himſelf, and to make an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Holland,</hi> and engage the States and <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Being informed by Mr. <hi>Locker</hi> that the Embaſſador of <hi>Portugal</hi> will ſet forward immediately for <hi>London,</hi> this makes me obſerve to you on the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59422:127"/>of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed ſufficiently of the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Nation, he ended by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating to the utmoſt point, that they are incapable whatever Peace is made, and whatever facility by this means his Catholick Majeſty has to employ all his Forces againſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> ever to yield they have any reaſon to be afraid. For, ſaid he to me, they will always maintain, at they do at preſent, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> can obtain no advantage of 'em, but by the Treachery of ſome of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguiſes</hi> themſelves; which they have publiſh'd to be the cauſe of the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Bajador,</hi> and not the fear of the Army which came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack their Lines. And it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that herein he has good reaſon, and ſpeaks as one that has a perfect knowledge of their humour, which may caſt 'em into ſome wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſaſter, for I do not perceive they ſeem to be concern'd to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to make an accommodation.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59422:127"/>So that for want of foreſight, the King and Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> run a great risk of falling into great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and loſing their Crown and Perſons, without bringing any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>We afterwards diſcourſed of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and agreed on what could be wiſht on both ſides, which is to ſay, if the War continued between his Catholick Majeſty and <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould obſerve a perfect neutrality, without giving any aſſiſtance, either during the preſent Reign, or under another, which might continue the War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and that on their ſide, if <hi>England</hi> ſhould come to have a War with us, they ſhould do the ſame in relation to us.</p>
               <p>I thought of getting clear out of this Conference, without a word of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, but I found my ſelf much miſtaken; for Don <hi>Lewis</hi> having made me the uſual declaration, that this point ſhou'd in no ſort retard the execution of the Peace; and I having
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59422:128"/>anſwered him, it would delay it, ſeeing he ſpoke to me continually about it, to the great prejudice of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe quiet ought not to be deferred one moment for the more or leſs ſatisfaction of a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who deſerved puniſhment, for having been guilty of the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Rebellion was ever ſeen: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by repeating to me the things he ſo often had mention'd to me, to wit the great advantages which the King drew from this Peace. He inſiſted mightily on the renunciation of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia,</hi> which the King his Maſter made without any recompence, tho' it be certain, that this Province and <hi>Briſac</hi> cannot be lawfully acquired by <hi>France,</hi> but by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s renunciation, to whom this ſhould return in caſe of failure of the Line of the Arch Duke of <hi>Inſpruck;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is certain he has reaſon, and that he looks with aſtoniſhment on all the great advantages which <hi>France</hi> gains; there being no inſtance of any Peace
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59422:128"/>ſhe has made, in which ſhe has ſo greatly profited, whether in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or number of Places, and extent of Country, which on all ſides enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges her Frontiers.</p>
               <p>In fine, the concluſion of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was, That though on account of all theſe Reaſons, the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter might expect ſome relaxations in favour of Monſieur the Prince, yet he had order to declare to me that his Catholick Majeſty would think himſelf obliged to the King, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as an effect of his generoſity: and that himſelf in particular would be ſo too, and do all things to ſhew me his acknowledgments, if I would uſe my endeavours for this.</p>
               <p>I told him, That as I could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repeat the ſame things every time he held me the ſame diſcourſes, I would only add, That theſe kind of generoſities are commonly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between private Perſons; but that great Kings, what Friendſhip ſoever they might have, never ſteer'd by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59422:129"/>theſe motives, in things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their reputation, and the good of their Kingdoms: and that as I would never pretend to the liberty of asking of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> any thing which ſhould be againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and honour; ſo I could not but find it ſtrange, that his Excellency, far from dealing thus, ſhould inſiſt ſtill on the ſame arguments, though I had (without vanity be it ſpoken) entirely overthrown 'em.</p>
               <p>He afterwards deſired me not to take it ill, if he propoſed to me an Expedient he had thought on, which was that his Catholick Majeſty, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King to give a place of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Monſieur the Prince, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre de Grace</hi> might be; ſhould give <hi>Olivenza</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his re-eſtabliſhment in his Lands and Honours, and the Office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told him I belived he jeer'd me, and that we ſhould make no great progreſs, if we ſpent our time in ſuch
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59422:129"/>kind of projects; that Monſieur the Prince would be more conſiderable with <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> than he was heretofore with all the Places and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments he had; and that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would receive for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of two Kingdoms he was now poſſeſt of, his Eſtate and a place which was in the heart of <hi>Spain</hi> forty Leagues off of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> which is to ſay, that inſtead of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this which was offered him was a Trap for him; and that did I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he offered me theſe Propoſals to move laughter, I ſhould have great reaſon to be ſcandaliz'd at his think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me a man fit to put ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on.</p>
               <p>He fell to laughing in effect, and replied to me, he ſaw well I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what kind of place <hi>Olivenza</hi> was, and that I had reaſon to ſay, that if his Maſter recovered <hi>Portugal,</hi> this place and that of <hi>Elvas</hi> ſhould be raiſed, as having been forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> only
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59422:130"/>to make head againſt the Countries under his Catholick Majeſty's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. However he omitted not for all this, to uſe other diſcourſes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monſieur the Prince; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I grew a little hot in my anſwers; <hi>Well then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we will conclude the Peace, we will do it ſincerely; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince ſhall caſt himſelf at his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's feet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him his Son, whom he ſhall leave with his Majeſty; and he will go to</hi> Venice, <hi>or</hi> Holland, <hi>where he may live on the Money my Maſter will give him in payment of what he owes him: and this will not be over well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwered him, that Monſieur the Prince accepting the favours the King offered him by the Peace, neither he, nor his Family would want the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Money for ſubſiſtance; and that as to the reſt, he need not be at the pains to caſt himſelf at the King's feet, nor bring his Son thither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he determined before hand to ſubmit to what he was obliged by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59422:130"/>the Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeeing without the King could not receive him, nor let him enjoy the Priviledges granted him by this Treaty. So that the Tryal he made to ſee whether the Prince might not do thus, ſerved only to diſabuſe him, and put him out of hopes of it.</p>
               <p>After this, I thought 'twas fit to conclude, although the Conference laſted not ſo long as half the time of the others, and I made the bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and rotten ways a pretence for this. But as I aroſe, he prayed me to give him the liberty of ſending Monſieur <hi>Pimentel</hi> to me, by whom he hoped to propoſe to me ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, as well in relation to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, as what remained to be adjuſted, which would be to my ſatisfaction. I told him I ſhould be very glad of it, deſiring nothing more than to embrace all thoſe which might put an end to this Negotiation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing the Honour or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59422:131"/>
               <p>But I muſt confeſs to you I was ſtrangely ſurpriſed when I found by the diſcourſe <hi>Pimentel</hi> held me, that inſtead of offering me Propoſals on the Overture I had made to uſe my endeavours with the King, to obtain ſome new favour for Monſieur the Prince, if he laid at his Majeſties feet the Places ſhould be given him by his Catholick Majeſty, he repeated to me the ſame things Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had mentioned to me to excite the King's Generoſity, and to oblige me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what in me lay thereto, and let ſlip before me, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> had promiſed to make him the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man in <hi>Spain,</hi> if he could prevail with me on this point.</p>
               <p>I replied to all this, that I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be angry with Don <hi>Lewis</hi> in thinking me capable to give at the ſtances of a Perſon whom he ſent me, what I had refuſed at his: and as to the reſt I took Monſieur <hi>Pimentel</hi> to be too honeſt a man to deſign the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his own Fortune on the ruine of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59422:131"/>my Reputation. After this, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be in a paſſion at Don <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>'s Proceedings, and to apprehend he had concealed Ends in theſe delays he brought in ſetling matters, which might have been adjuſted in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conference, adding, I did not doubt but if I imparted this manner of proceeding to the King, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would command my return, it being apparent this delay greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced his Affairs. For beſides his loſing ſeveral advantages which he might reaſonably expect in this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, he is likewiſe obliged on the belief the Peace will be ſoon proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to hold his Allies in Suſpence, who preſs him on all hands to make particular Treaties with them.</p>
               <p>In fine, to avoid the prolixity wherein I ſhould fall, were I to give a particular account of what paſt with <hi>Pimentel,</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf, with aſſuring their Majeſties, that I ſent him away as well ſatisfied with my reaſons as I could be my ſelf, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59422:132"/>in a diſpoſition of apprehending great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Reſolutions I might take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: and being not yet ſatisfied with whatever I had ſaid to him, I wrote to Monſieur <hi>de Lionne,</hi> who was at <hi>Andaye,</hi> to the end that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating my Note to the Sieur <hi>Pimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> he might the more eaſily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to repreſent the ſame things to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> and in a manner as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt as I had explained my ſelf in; of which charge I do not doubt but he will well acquit himſelf, hoping that in the firſt Conference Don <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> will yield to the putting an end to this affair.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs ended not here, for continuing to ſpeak to me ſtill on Monſieur the Prince, he told me he could ſafely call God to witneſs, that he had no other motive in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, than to ſee all Parties ſo well ſatisfied, that there might never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the leaſt alteration in the Peace which was about concluding; and that as my particular friend he would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59422:132"/>entruſt me with a ſcruple which came into his head, which was, that he greatly apprehended leſt the Infanta, who on one hand had a great deal of wit, and on the other a great deal of tenderneſs for the King her Father, having heard talk of nothing elſe for ſeveral years, but the great ſervices Monſieur the Prince had rendred him; that he had been the cauſe, by the diverſions made in <hi>France,</hi> of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and the reduction of all <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and other Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which <hi>Spain</hi> had obtained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in taking Places from us, and eſpecially <hi>Cambray,</hi> the preſervation of which they believe they wholly owe to him; that he apprehended, I ſay, That coming into <hi>France</hi> with all theſe things in her mind, ſhe ſhould prevail in all occaſions relating to the Prince's Service, in procuring him the King's favour, and all the marks of it he could deſire; which perhaps might not produce a good effect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relation to the Publick, or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59422:133"/>what might particularly concern me.</p>
               <p>I replied to him with a ſmiling Countenance, that I found my ſelf greatly obliged to him for his good intentions, and the Friendſhip he ſhewed me, in opening to me his heart on ſo nice an affair; but I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to be much troubled at whatever might happen hereupon; becauſe that though I no ways doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the inclinations of the Sereniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima Infanta towards Monſieur the Prince, whom ſhe loved as a faithful Servant of her Father, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Monarchy, not knowing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent other intereſts than thoſe of the King her Father; yet I aſſured my ſelf, that being the King's Wife, ſhe would prefer the Intereſts and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King her Husband and his Children before any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and look with an ill Eye on Monſieur the Prince, as believing him capable of falling again into the ſame faults, to the prejudice of a Kingdom of which ſhe would be the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59422:133"/>Queen: and though I had well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that his Excellency had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with ſpeaking of the inclination of the Infanta for Monſieur the Prince, without mentioning any thing of the averſion ſhe had for me, who have done a great deal more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Houſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> than Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince had done for it. I ever doubted of the Hatred of the Infanta to me, without any great trouble, conſidering from the ſame reaſon, that becoming Queen of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe would honour with her good will a Perſon who has ſerved the King and Kingdom with all the Fidelity and Induſtry poſſible, and who would continue to do it to his laſt breath: So that marrying the King, Monſieur the Prince and I ſhould change places in her affections, where ſhe would give me that he poſſeſſes at preſent, and to him mine.</p>
               <p>I am now to tell you, to the end their Majeſties may know it, that I have learnt from <hi>Pimentel,</hi> that the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59422:134"/>Horſes which Don <hi>Lewis</hi> would give to the King, which according to the relation of thoſe who have ſeen them, are the ſtatelieſt in the World, will not be preſented in his name, but in the name of the Catholick King, who has ordered him to put them into my hands to take care they be ſent to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>So that we muſt think of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Preſent to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which I will remit to Don <hi>Lewis</hi> by the King's order, to the end he may carry it to the King his Maſter. I have already wrote to <hi>Paris</hi> what I judge fit, and in due time, will ſend the Memorial of things, of which I think the Preſent ſhould conſiſt; and though 'tis uſual to give things wherein there is more Art than Riches, yet I will endeavour ſo to order it, that here may be both.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo make a conſiderable Preſent to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> as well for that he will ſign the Articles of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as that it will be he that will
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59422:134"/>Eſpouſe the Infanta in Virtue of the King's Power, and ſign the Treaty likewiſe of Peace. A Preſent muſt likewiſe be made to the Secretary of State Don <hi>Pedro Coloma.</hi>

               <p>I have put ſomething into the Letters which I gave to <hi>Meſſieurs de Noailles</hi> and <hi>de Vardes</hi> for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, touching what paſt in Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's Conference; but ſeeing the Sieur <hi>Bartret</hi> will arrive ſooner than they, to give an account to their Majeſties, that I thought in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt Conference, that all would break off, conſidering how Don <hi>Lewis</hi> ſpake to me of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Monſieur the Prince, in telling me with great concern, 'twas very ſtrange, that after ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances made, he might not obtain that the Catholick King ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the Services which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince had done him.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59422:135"/>we ſhould break off the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, but he quickly grew cool, and hindred me from riſing up, with great proteſtations his Intention was always the ſame in relation to the Peace, the conſummation of which was no longer to be doubted; ſo that having been ſometime without appeaſing my ſelf, I began again to treat with him as before, and the end of this Conference, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near Six Hours, was well enough, as their Majeſties will ſee by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſhall ſend them.

               <p>I Will now make you a Rehearſal of what paſt in Yeſterdays Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59422:137"/>which was the Eighth, to the end their Majeſties may know the particulars of it. It began with the Intereſts of Monſieur <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> on occaſion of the Sieur <hi>de la Chauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,</hi> who came from him, and brought Letters for Don <hi>Lewis</hi> and me. Don <hi>Lewis</hi> told me, this Duke deſired leave to come here to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in perſon his own Affairs, but he muſt ſee the King his Maſter firſt; and he ſpake to me in terms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I eaſily found his intention was not to bring him here in haſte; and Don <hi>Lewis</hi> having ever ſpoken to me about the Duke, as of a Perſon who enjoy'd his full liberty: I thought it therefore not amiſs to hint to him by the way, that this Gentleman knew otherwiſe, ſeeing he told me, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> thought himſelf under a greater conſtraint than ever, in that he was oblig'd to give it under his hand not to ſtir from <hi>Toledo</hi> and the adjacent places, and not to come within Six Leagues
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59422:137"/>of <hi>Madrid;</hi> ſo that he was more confined now than when he had his Guards; for then he flatter'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome hopes of eſcaping, of which he could have no thoughts now.</p>
               <p>I told him moreover ſomething of the Converſation which I had with this Gentleman, to confirm him by the anſwers I had made, that the King intended to alter nothing which had been determined at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in relation to <hi>Lorrain.</hi> But it's fit their Majeſties ſhould know the diſcourſe I had with the Sieur de <hi>Chauſſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He began by telling me, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would ſee the beſt Friend, and moſt affectionate Servant I had in the World; that he deſired nothing with greater paſſion than my Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that his intention was not to marry, nor to return into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> if 'twere not deſired; but to remit all to Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Nephew, and to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:59422:138"/>or any other place his Majeſty ſhould preſcribe; that he would reſolve on all this with Madam, and with his Brother, and other Princes of his Houſe; and that, in fine, he had ſtill ſome intereſt in the World, and Friends to render ſome ſignal Service to <hi>France,</hi> if his Majeſty thought fit to employ him the reſt of his days.</p>
               <p>Hitherto all went well, but the end ſpoiled all; for he added, that his Maſter would chuſe rather to dye a thouſand Deaths, than to re-enter into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> on condition of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the leaſt part of it; and that I ought to intereſs my ſelf herein, by reaſon of the Alliance he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to me. In fine, he talk'd to me of reſtoring all to Monſieur <hi>de Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> juſt as if it had been no more than a pair of Gloves.</p>
               <p>I told him, I was ſorry for the Propoſal of the Alliance which his Highneſs had ordered him to make me, becauſe this ſtopt my Mouth,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59422:138"/>and hindered me from ſpeaking ſo much as one word in favour of his Intereſts, it being impoſſible to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every one from believing that my own would make me ſpeak, tho' in effect I could never have any other than thoſe of the King and the State, for the leaſt of which I ſhould think my ſelf happy to ſacrifice both my Family and my own Perſon; that after this, his Highneſs would plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee I was the unlikelieſt Inſtrument to procure any change in what had been determin'd at <hi>Paris</hi> with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Plenipotentiary, and ratifyed afterwards; that I might truly ſay, the King's Goodneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Duke, and <hi>Lorrain</hi> and his Family, had been extraordinary; ſeeing that if his Majeſty had ſtood out from yielding the point of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and reſtoring ſo many Places as he yields by the Treaty of Peace, on condition of retaining <hi>Lorrain,</hi> no body doubts but the Catholick King would have conſented to it.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:59422:139"/>
               <p>I told him further, That there were ſeveral Perſons who well knew Don <hi>Lewis</hi> his mind, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that if we would only re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Monſieur the Prince in what he had before his Rebellion, he would willingly have yielded all <hi>Lorrain</hi> to the King. I ſhew'd my ſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very much ſurprized at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s having ſo much as a thought that others could obtain more for him than he could obtain for himſelf; ſeeing by the Treaty he made in 1639, with the deceaſed King, he authentically yielded the Comte of <hi>Clermont, Stenay,</hi> and <hi>Jamets:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, having promis'd and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd ſeveral other things, with an expreſs proteſtation to forfeit all his Countries in caſe he fail'd therein, yet he had kept nothing which he had promis'd ſince his re-entrance; that the King dealt very favourably with him, in reſtoring to him all <hi>Lorrain,</hi> on the conditions mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaty of <hi>Paris;</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59422:139"/>ſince this Treaty his Highneſs had continu'd with more obſtinacy than ever to ſerve <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France;</hi> that all the World muſt needs be ſurpriz'd at the King's Generoſity, who poſſeſſing all <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able eaſily to keep it, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd it almoſt entire to the Duke, who Fifteen years before had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to ſignalize his averſion againſt this Crown; and that this Generoſity appear'd the greater, in that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom the Duke had ſo long time and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully ſerv'd, had clapt him up in Priſon, inſtead of rewarding him.</p>
               <p>I ended this Diſcourſe, in praying the Gentleman to tell or write to his Maſter, that he had reaſon to think himſelf happy, for the manner after which <hi>France</hi> dealt with him; and to have a livelier ſenſe of this, he need only to call to mind the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Princes who had unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loſt their Countries, tho' they had not done the Hundred part of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59422:140"/>what his Highneſs had done againſt <hi>France;</hi> and that without having recourſe to paſt Ages, there were Examples to be met with in this; as thoſe of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo many Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wholly ſtript or deprived of the greateſt part of what they had; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been no longer out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries than the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and having had the good fortune to be protected by <hi>France, Swedeland,</hi> and the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſed to hearken to any terms of Peace, if the Emperour did not entirely re-eſtabliſh him; he, I ſay, thought himſelf very happy to ſacrifice one part of his Country to recover another. And to ſhut the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Mouth, I added, that ſuppoſing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had as much affection for him, and as great deſire to oblige him, as the contrary has appeared by the rigorous uſage they have ſhew'd him (it being not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59422:140"/>very ordinary to detain Soveraign Princes) yet the neceſſity of their Affairs would hardly permit them to do more for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> than <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Swedeland</hi> could do for the <hi>Palatin,</hi> when their Armies were victorious in <hi>Germany.</hi> Beſides, there could be no likelihood that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould obtain more for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> than they could obtain for themſelves; and ſo much the leſs, in that they having loſt a great many Places by the War, were conſtrain'd to give up a great part of 'em for the procuring a Peace.</p>
               <p>I return to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, as I have already told you, to make a freſh ſally with all his Forces in behalf of Monſieur the Prince, ſaying, that the King his Maſter would not be content with this Peace, if we were reſolv'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no expedient, by whoſe means he might in ſome ſort acquit himſelf
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59422:141"/>of his Engagements, in as much as Monſieur the Prince having no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and wandring where God ſhould direct him, it would be impoſſible to enjoy the effects of the Peace ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as the King his Maſter wiſh'd. And tho' he ſhew'd a great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſaying to me what I now tell you, yet I affected to anſwer him with great ſedateneſs; ſaying, that I was very much obliged to him for his freedom of expreſſions to me, in what he had now uttered, being a kind of declaration, that the Peace ſhould not laſt long; that I no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wondered at what Don <hi>Chriſtoval</hi> told the Abbot <hi>Siri;</hi> that if he were not obliged to publiſh ſo ſoon what paſt in relation to the Peace, he would have occaſion to write in another manner in a ſhort time; ſo that I ſaw I had nothing elſe to do but to take my leave of him, with the greateſt grief, in having been ſo good a Prophet, when having ſeen
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59422:141"/>him return ſo many times to preſs me about the Prince, I had ſaid, that the conſideration of Monſieur the Prince having hindred the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peace of Chriſtendom at <hi>Madrid</hi> above Three years ſince, his Intereſt would ſtill hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace, which was ſo lately Signed and Ratified at <hi>Paris;</hi> and that I truſted God, who had beſtowed ſo many Bleſſings on <hi>France,</hi> for a Recompence of the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, who in the midſt of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes had ſent even to <hi>Madrid</hi> for a Peace, without obtaining it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the firmneſs with which his Catholick Majeſty had inſiſted on the Prince's ſatisfactions, that he, I ſay, would crown his Majeſties Arms with greater Succeſſes, for having brought on his ſide ſo great facilities towards the concluſion of the Peace, when his Arms were in a condition to make on all ſides a greater progreſs than ever.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59422:142"/>
               <p>I cannot ſufficiently repreſent to their Majeſties how greatly he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd aſtoniſh'd at my anſwer, and I ſhould be oblig'd to a long Diſcourſe, if I would write all the particulars he uttered to me, and all the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he made me not to take in ill part what he had ſaid to me; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting again, that the conſideration of Monſieur the Prince ſhould never hinder the execution of the Peace; and that if he had told me, the King his Maſter would not be ſatisfied, it was not with the Peace he meant, but only for the not having obtain'd what he deſired in favour of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince. It will be enough to ſay, that by his way and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I had cauſe quickly to appeaſe my ſelf, but I dexterouſly kept my ſelf from ſhewing it, to induce him the more to put an end to our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>I told him then, this was a new method of Negotiating, to ſay that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59422:142"/>Monſieur the Prince ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſummation of the Peace, whilſt in effect he did hinder it by a continual returning to his Intereſts; and having before he ſpake to me of this ill ſatisfaction of the King his Maſter, replied to me all the ſame Reaſons he had alledg'd to me in favour of the Prince, ſetting perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually before me, that Rebellions were common in <hi>France,</hi> and that thoſe who had been guilty of 'em had been always re-eſtabliſh'd; and hinting to me again what was done in reſpect to the Conſtable of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I thought my ſelf oblig'd to anſwer him, that I was tired with hearing the ſame things ſo many times repeated, and ſo much the more in that I did not doubt but he was convinc'd by the anſwers I made him, to inform him, and give him means to confound <hi>Lainet,</hi> and the other Adherents of Monſieur the Prince, who continually furniſh'd
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59422:143"/>him with Arms, tho' weak ones, to defend his cauſe; that we ſhould once for all agree to bring no more into debate ſuch points as had been already decided; it ſeeming to me I had ſufficiently ſhew'd him, that if Rebellions were more frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>French,</hi> they were more dangerous, and of longer durance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that if he would take the pains to examin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner they were chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>France,</hi> when there was an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing it, he would ſoon ſee by the ſeverity which all its Kings have uſed, that they were not very encouraging to the <hi>French</hi> to make revolts; that not to aſcend higher than the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. he would find the Marſhal of <hi>Biron</hi> with his Head taken off, without having executed any thing of what he had projected againſt the State; he would ſee the laſt Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> ſo Illuſtrious by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59422:143"/>of his Anceſtours, chaſtis'd in the ſame manner as <hi>Biron,</hi> the Quality of his Relations, and the endeavours uſed on all hands to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Pardon, being not able to prevail with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. He would ſee Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars</hi> Grand Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuyer and Favourite of this King, and <hi>Thuanus</hi> puniſh'd in the ſame faſhion, the firſt having executed nothing of the Treaty made with the Count Duke <hi>D'Olivarez,</hi> nor the ſecond committed any other crime than that of having known the thing, in which he had no part, and not having revealed it; that as to Monſieur the Prince, I could not but remember his Excellency, that <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his great Grandfather would have had his Head taken off at <hi>Orleans,</hi> had not <hi>Francis</hi> II. dyed ſuddenly on the Eve of the Day he intended this Execution to be done.</p>
               <p>I ended, in deſiring him to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59422:144"/>Monſieur the Prince's People not to have ſo often in their mouths the Example of the Conſtable of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for if he made often his accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, becauſe the neceſſity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs required it, yet he at length loſt his Head.</p>
               <p>The Don <hi>Lewis</hi> cryed out, 'twas true, but in the accommodations he was always re-eſtabliſh'd in his Eſtate, and even in the Places he had on the <hi>Somme. Ah, Sir,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>would you have Monſieur the Prince now re-eſtabliſh'd, and make ſuch an end as the Conſtable of St.</hi> Paul <hi>did? I believe you love him too well to wiſh him the ſame Fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is fit their Majeſties ſhould know, that by the Diſcourſe Don <hi>Lewis</hi> has held to me in this Rencounter, I have plainly found out, that he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me the ſubſtance of the Letters which <hi>Croiſy</hi> wrote to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> and the Memoirs which have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59422:144"/>been ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> by Monſieur the Prince.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe experimented, that it has befall'n Don <hi>Lewis</hi> what uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens to thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to fight, by their being ſhew'd their Honour is therein engag'd; which is to ſay, to depart the Liſts with diſadvantage, becauſe they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in entred againſt their Wills, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deliver themſelves from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their Friends.</p>
               <p>He has been moſt certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, he might boldly ſay what he liſt, and without any danger threaten the breaking off of the Treaty, without this endangering of me to reſolve on a Rupture: And therefore I have omitted nothing to deliver him from this conceit, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known to him, as I have done in this Conference, that tho' the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with which their Majeſties wiſh for Peace be apparent to all the World, and that on my ſide, I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59422:145"/>ſhould have an extreme regret to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hence without concluding any thing, and in the aſſurance of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War begin again, yet I muſt eſteem it advantagious, and even glorious this ſhould happen on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince's account, it being certain, that not only this Action would be blamed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that even the very Stones in the Street would riſe up againſt thoſe who had been the cauſe of this.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Lewis</hi> replyed to me what is preciſely in one of <hi>Croiſy</hi>'s Letters, which is, that all <hi>France</hi> would be in an uproar, if it were known the Peace fail'd of being concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a reaſonable Satisfaction was not given Monſieur the Prince: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards uſing me with great gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he told me, after a Thouſand Flatteries, he could ſwear we ſhould part the beſt Friends in the World; and began to enter on the Overture I have already denoted I made, to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59422:145"/>give to the King the Places with which Monſieur the Prince was to be gratified; and that in this caſe, I would caſt my ſelf at the King's Feet, to entreat him to beſtow on the Prince and his Son ſome favours by means of which both one and the other might be better aſſured of his Majeſty's Goodneſs to 'em.</p>
               <p>He told me then, that if I made this Overture to give him a mark of my Kindneſs, to the end, to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly diſengage the King his Maſter from Monſieur the Prince, and that I had no other motive of ſupplicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King to make him a better Treatment, aſſuring his Majeſty, that the Prince ſhould lay at his Feet the Gratification which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould make him, we might ſoon come to an Agreement, ſeeing he did not believe that in this caſe I ſhould inſiſt on the more or the leſs.</p>
               <p>I interrupted him here, entreating
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59422:146"/>him in no ſort to ſpeak to me of this, becauſe I could not ſee any Reaſon to hope that the King would conſent to it, and that it was out of pure Affection I undertook to intercede with his Majeſty, to the end, that when the Prince begg'd Pardon for the fault he had committed, and did remit into his Hands the Places which his Catholick Majeſty ſhould give him, he might then give him and his Son ſome proof of his Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I greatly extended this Diſcourſe, omitting nothing which might warrant him, and engage him to accept of this Expedient, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to edg him on by the refuſal I made.</p>
               <p>And perceiving from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he pretended to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in giving ſomething of ſmall conſideration, I replyed to him, That ſhould he conſent to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to the King whatever I knew had been offered to Monſieur the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59422:146"/>Prince, I had very ſtrong Reaſons to be perſwaded that his Majeſty would be againſt it, and the Queen would, in the opinion which ſhe had of the Prince, confirm his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>He entreated me not to doubt of the Offer he had made me hereupon, in propoſing to give to the Prince ſome Places in Soveraignty; but that <hi>Lainet</hi> well knew theſe Places were to be given him only with the Securities and neceſſary Precautions of never diſpoſing of them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King, nor ſerving his Majeſty with the ſaid Places, and farther on condition, that the Line of Monſieur the Prince failing, they ſhould return to <hi>Spain.</hi> He ask'd me, whether I believ'd 'twas the ſame thing to give on theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Places to Monſieur the Prince, as to give them purely to the King; and whether there was any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between adding to ſo many
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59422:147"/>Conqueſts, which the King retain'd in the Low Countries, what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given to the Prince, or to give 'em to this Prince, who would have nothing elſe but theſe, and who might in a Thouſand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures profitably ſerve <hi>Spain;</hi> and that by the ſame reaſon, I told him the King would never conſent to this; I need not doubt but this was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the King his Maſter.</p>
               <p>I anſwer'd him, I could not but agree with him; there was great difference between giving to the King and to Monſieur the Prince; and that for this effect, giving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, I would not fail in uſing my endeavours with his Majeſty, as I had already offer'd, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſponſible in any ſort for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting this Overture.</p>
               <p>He continued afterwards his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and I cannot ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to their Majeſties the pain he had to bring forth the Propoſition
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59422:147"/>which aſſuredly he had premeditated to make me, when he ſhould ſee the Sally I now ſpake of would not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>In fine, having told me he would make me an offer, in which he ſhould confound what the King his Maſter would do for the Prince, and what he would give for <hi>Bergue,</hi> reckoning <hi>la Baſſee</hi> for nothing, becauſe it ſhould be demoliſh'd; he ſpake to me of <hi>Mariembourg</hi> and <hi>Philippe ville,</hi> with their dependances, exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quality and importance of theſe two Towns, in telling me, that <hi>Caracene</hi> had ſignified to him, they could not be alienated without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an irreparable prejudice to <hi>Spain</hi> in all ſhe poſſeſs'd on the ſide of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I replyed to him, he was in jeſt, or thought me very ignorant, and eaſily impos'd on, that he muſt not ſpeak to me but of <hi>Aire,</hi> St. <hi>Omers,</hi> or <hi>Cambraye,</hi> and <hi>du Cambreſis,</hi> or of <hi>Avenues, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59422:148"/>Philippe ville,</hi> and <hi>Mariem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> as they were offer'd to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince. I believ'd it fit to propoſe this, tho' their Majeſties know only the laſt Places were offer'd to him; and as to us, we may truly ſay, that the firſt, which is to ſay <hi>Avenues,</hi> is worth the three others.</p>
               <p>He replyed to me, that not to ſpend the time fruitleſly, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to declare to me, taking God to witneſs, that there had never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention made of <hi>Avenues</hi> to the Prince: And after a Thouſand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions, and inexpreſſible Pangs to bring forth the word, he ſaid in fine, to make an end of the buſineſs, he would diſpatch in all haſte to the King his Maſter, to intreat him to approve of the offering of <hi>Avenues,</hi> which was in our reſpect far more important than <hi>Cambray;</hi> and that this was a thing of ſo great moment, and which would make ſo many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple murmur againſt him for the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59422:148"/>ſuch a Propoſal, that he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me not to take him at his word, nor build on what he told me till he had receiv'd an anſwer from <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' I was lively touch'd with this Propoſal, there being nothing in my opinion more profitable to the King than the acquiſition of <hi>Avenues,</hi> which is aſſuredly one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Places in the Low Countries, and which renders us more powerful than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Hainault,</hi> and wholly covers <hi>Tierache</hi> and <hi>Champain,</hi> when we ſhall have withdrawn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croy:</hi> yet I ſhew'd him great coldneſs, ſaying, the offer was not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what we rendred, and to the effect my endeavours with the King might produce in the Princes favour, if his Majeſty ſhould like it.</p>
               <p>He hereupon ſeem'd mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and at the point of deſpair, and crying out, he was very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, ſeeing I made no reckoning of an offer which he trembled for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59422:149"/>having made, as fearing the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> would riſe up againſt him when they ſhall hear the news of it.</p>
               <p>And I continuing in my coldneſs, intreated him not to expoſe himſelf to the reproach would be made him in <hi>Spain,</hi> for having offered me <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi> beſides <hi>Philippe ville</hi> and <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> ſeeing the Peace concluded at <hi>Paris</hi> might be executed without a word of all this, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do but to retain, as it is contain'd in this Treaty, <hi>Bergue,</hi> and <hi>la Baſſee,</hi> which the King would never ſuffer to be raiſed on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, conſidering the Contributions eſtabliſh'd in this Country by the means of this Place, which whether by its Scituation, or Fortification, was in time of War far more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than any of thoſe he offered me. I ſaid this, tho' I knew well the contrary, and that the King could not retain <hi>la Baſſee</hi> without raiſing it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59422:149"/>Three Months after; that as to the Prince, I would ask nothing, but on the contrary, be eternally obliged to him, if he would exempt me from executing a Propoſition, which the only Paſſion of obliging his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency had conſtrain'd me to make; that there was no more to do but to keep to the Treaty of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to give Monſieur the Prince a Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Money; to which I declared the King would not oppoſe, and thus this Negotiation without any more delay would be ended.</p>
               <p>All this ſerv'd only to heat him the more in the deſire of procuring by all ſorts of means ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Prince; and he told me, I had given him a good Example of what he ought to do, by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing inſtances I had made him in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> even to the offering that the King ſhould yield to his Catholick Majeſty one of the beſt Places left him, provided

                  <hi>Juliers</hi> were rendred to this Duke. It was eaſie for me to ſilence him hereupon, in anſwering, that not to take notice of the diſparity between a Free Prince and a Subject, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a place which had been depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in truſt to have it again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when the Duke needed no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and what the King had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to the Prince when he was in his Duty; this Prince, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Perfidiouſneſs, had abuſed Places and Governments which he held from the King, in favouring the Enterpriſes of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that with all this diſparity, after having inſiſted a little in favour of the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi> the King gave over this point, being ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, whatever Juſtice there was in his pretenſion to retard one moment the quiet of Chriſtendom for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a particular Perſon, tho' never ſo well grounded; but that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59422:150"/>his Excellency, inſtead of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, return'd continually to the Charge, eſteeming himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vanquiſh'd on the Intereſt of Monſieur the Prince; that I hoped he would honour me with ſo good an opinion of me, to believe I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither Underſtanding nor Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to maintain the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>'s Cauſe, had not the Commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the People, who groan under the delays of the Peace, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King's Heart, and obliged his Majeſty to ſend me order to no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſiſt thereupon.</p>
               <p>And I ended, in telling him, I was not ſurpriſed at the obſtinacy I found in his Excellency, when the Queſtion concerned the reſtoring to this Duke a Place which the Catholick King held only as a Pledge; it not being the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion ever to reſtore what they once get hold on, unleſs it be to draw thence a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; ſo that I could not but be
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59422:151"/>troubled they had not yet learned the way of parting with what was not their own, whatever Example <hi>France</hi> has given them of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the laſt Treaty, by which ſhe reſtored above Twenty Places to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> tho' they had coſt the Crown ſo much Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Conference ended in our mutual promiſing that no mention ſhould be made to any body of what had been treated, and eſpecially of the offer he had made me; and that we ſhould ſpend one whole day in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the things we had diſcours'd of; that we ſhould ſee one another to day, and that I ſhould return him an anſwer on the propoſal he had made me from his own part, without power from the King his Maſter.</p>
